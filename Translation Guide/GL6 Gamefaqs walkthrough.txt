---Introduction---

Growlanser VI: Precarious World is, as the name implies, the sixth main game
of the series. This FAQ focuses on providing a walkthrough for the missions in
the game and STRAIGHT game advancement, but plot summaries are provided as
well. Information here are derived from my gameplay, so there may exist
possibilities of slight differences between yours and mine. However, the setup
and advancement should pretty much adhere.

Take note that this FAQ is based on the Japanese version and includes full or
part spoilers. If you want to avoid most spoilers, skip the story events and
'Characters' section. The FAQ is also written based on the assumption that you
do know some basic Japanese and in cases whereby official names(according to
Atlus JP/Team Career) are known, they will be used.

Any errors may be directed to my email.

---Prologue notes---

If you don't wish to go through the prologue at all, choose not interested to
skip the entire thing and get a clear bonus(the easiest and recommended way,
take note this gives a totally balanced triangle diagram).

The prologue(character making session) affects the starting stats development
of Merklich. In this area, you are free to do what you want and don't want.
Therefore, feel free to explore around to collect the events. If you managed
to obtain at least 15 events out of 18, the woman who appeared and gave you
directions during this entire scenario will express satisfaction. However,
even if you didn't, it won't affect or end the game in any way.

I'll list the events that I managed to get(though I'm still unsure on how the
game calculates the total evaluation):

My numeral listing below does not imply the exact event listing[i.e (1) does
NOT represent things you need to do to finish event no.1], but rather a guide
so you know what to do first to trigger related ones):

(1)
- Talk to Soldier A who is standing guard
- Agree to help him inform the standby Soldier B to change the duty turn
- Go to the lower right and knock on the office's door
- Go back to Soldier A and tell him Soldier B will be late
- Go to the inn and tell the girl at the back of the inn that A will be late
- Go and talk to A again for a Pearl bead

(2)
- Talk to the Soldier C standing outside the guard's office
- Agree to challenge him to knock down his defense wall
- Press Circle button in quick intervals(don't mash it repeatedly)

(3)

(4)
-Talk to the Soldier D on the right side outside the inn after (3)

 analogue stick

(5)

(6)
-Inside the Inn, go north till you can no more and then to the right for a
 Pearl Bead

(7)

-Use the Dream Key(rare finds menu) on the western blue door of the village
-Next screen, talk to the old man on the right

-Go back to the village
-Notice there are a bunch of pillars before the altar cavern
-Choose to shake(hit) the pillars until you locate the gale apple(position
 is random)
-Talk to the old man and the kids

(8)
-After (7), go into the inn and talk to the innkeeper
-Agree to exchange the Gale Apple for the Toolbox.

(9)

-Go back to the village and talk to the old man
-Agree to exchange recovery medicine for the hip pain medicine

-Talk to him again about the money he gave you earlier to buy the medicine

(10)
-After (8), from the Dream Key room, go out south to the city
-Talk to the soldier coming out of the elevator
-Go into the elevator and down to talk to the armorer
-After the conversation, give him the Toolbox.

(11)
-Go to the city via the Dream Key room and walk straight down and left out
-Help out the soldiers by fighting the Gels.
-Use Fire Arrow Magic(don't try physical attacks)
-Get Ambrosia(use it to refill your used up MP, if you keep it, it will be
 brought over to the main game)
-Search the field for the shiny item(Pearl Bead)

(12)
-After (9) and (10), go to the city and down the elevator
-Talk to the girl standing in front of the sparkling trees
-Offer 20 Mil and pick up shiny item for a Pearl bead

(13)
-In the city, knock on the lower right house
-Agree to go through the memory test
-After some conversation inside, you get to move around
-Memorize the layout of the house, that is: the position of the barrels,
 treasure chests(opened or not) and crates.
-Once ready, talk to the man and screen switch. Now look around and spot any
 changes.
-Go to that changed item and press Circle(one is enough)
-You get Pearl Bead

(14)
-In the city, down the elevator, talk to the kids in the north.
-Agree to play
-Memorize the names of the 3 kids.
-The shuffle will begin, and from left to right, choose the correct name from
 the list given for each kid.

(15)
-After (13), talk to the kids again.
-Agree to play
-It's a loop race, and you run to the southeastern end first, then the
 southwest, and back up. Well, in another format, the race path is something
 like:
             
              __S
             |NW \
             |    \
             |     \
            /       \
           /WS     ES\
           -----------
         
S:  Starting point
WS: Kid standing at the Southwest end
ES: Kid standing at the Southeast end
NE: Kid standing at the Northwest end

All those lines are the race path.

S->ES->WS->NW->S to complete the race. No shortcuts, but unless you walk
instead of run, there's no way to lose.

(16)
-Talk to the couple having a conversation at the bench in the city
-Walk over to the south
-Choose to search around the row of bushes for a recovery medicine.

(17)
-Search the shiny item at bridge(city) for a Pearl Bead

(18)
-After you've done 1,5,6,11,12,13 and 17, talk to the man in the city who lost
 his necklace because the string broke and give him the beads you gathered.

(19)
-Look at the radar when in the city,there is a green dot on the right. Go and
 talk to the man hidding there to start a quiz.
-Answers: Blue, Right analogue stick, Right analogue stick, Press X while
 using the d-pad to walk, Business Suit

If you wish to, head back to the village and opt to enter the middle door on
the right for the last test:

Usable Characters: Merklich
Recommended Level: Nil
Enemies          : 3 Heavy Punchers
NPCs             : 4 villagers, 1 soldier


Press X to signal for the villagers to start escaping. Use Fire Arrow on all
of the fires to make them stronger to attract the attention of the monsters.
Use a recovery medicine on the injured soldier and he will join in the fight.
The moment you give him the medicine, the X signal will be void as the
villagers will start escaping. All you need is to use your normal attacks or
magic on the monsters. After the villagers have made their escape, the soldier
will do the same, have Merk continue attacking the enemies, once all are dead,
it's done.

+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+

Here, choose to bring over your Growlanser V: Generations save data if you
have it(which will affect the statistics of a character you will get much
later on in the game: Zeon). I would assume only save data from the Japanese
version will work. If you don't have any, just save and exit.

You can press L1, L2, R1, R2, SELECT and START all at the same time to go back
to the title screen if you messed up anywhere during the course of the entire
game and wish to restart.

***IMPORTANT***
P/S: Before I go on, please take note that I do not know the specific criteria
for getting mission completes, and the possibilities I wrote down represents
the things I did which got me a mission complete so you can use them as a
reference, but not as absolute. Take note though that from past experiences,
the time used to finish a mission(even when there isn't a time counter/limit)
may play a hidden part in some missions, therefore always aim to finish a
mission fitting the requirements using as little time as possible. There are
also situations whereby the death of an ally(even if you revive using the
nectar) may also prevent one from getting a complete. Furthermore, it may be
possible for you to get mission complete by other methods from mine(especially
in cases whereby there are 2 clear conditions), therefore please stick to
yours.

Mission completes give Rana fruits instead of seeds and the EXP, technique
points and money obtained is also higher. I firmly believe it does help with
your characters relationship levels(refer to first paragraph of the coliseum
for explanation).

ALSO, it is possible to get all mission completes for this game. And I have
not gotten any special bonus from getting a full 100%, therefore it is not
necessary unless you are a perfectionist.

NPCs                 : None
Clear conditions     - All terrorists defeated
Game Over conditions - Death of Merklich or Wendy

Here, you can go ahead and try to defeat the terrorists. They will most likely
end up successfully setting up the bomb and even if you defeat all of them,
the bomb will explode and you will watch a short cutscene. Thereafter the
Mission Battles Continue System will function. Basically, it retains data just
before the last Mission and in the case of game over, you can choose Continue
from the Title Screen and restart the Mission battle with no consideration of
where you last saved. Take note that the data will be gone once you reset the
console.

You'll automatically restart from before the terrorists come in. This time
round, go out via the door from which the terrorists came by earlier.

Clear conditions     - All terrorists defeated
Game Over conditions - Terrorist successfully set up bomb
                     - Death of Merklich or Wendy

Clear conditions     - All enemies defeated
Game Over conditions - Lost of required evidence
                     - All party members eliminated

Once you get to control Merklich, run like there's no tomorrow to attack the
terrorist archer at the far eastern end of the screen, don't bother about the
rest. If you cannot, then start to chant magic and attack him. After a short
while, Shuweizer will come in from the bottom left and the enemies will come
up with another plan.

Clear conditions     - All enemies defeated
Game Over conditions - Terrorist set up the fire ignition device at the
                       documents base, and chant a magic spell to light it up
                     - All party members eliminated

The terrorist archer I mentioned earlier will rush to set up the ignition
device, but Shuweizer can't catch up to him. The terrorist group leader will
chant the magic. Kill off the archer first, then the rest, and finally the
leader. Try to kill the enemies with Merklich and Wendy because if it's
Shuweizer who defeated the enemies, your party don't get any experience
points. It doesn't matter that much though, there's no need to restart the
mission if you failed to do so.

[Mission complete possibilites] - Did not let enemy set up device
                                - Defeated all enemies

-Leave the sewer, either by treking back or using Return magic
-Go to the library north of the town, enter the now functional elevator
-Select 4F, enter and search shelf 2B, books no. 101~150, specifically 133

-Go back out to the inn and ask to meet Rat again

Location             : Shizland Plateau
Usable Characters    : Merklich, Wendy
Recommended Level    : 5-6
Enemies              - 4 Lv 4 imposter soldiers
                     - 2 Lv 6 imposter soldiers
NPCs                 : 2 Fomeros soldiers, 2 Hingistan soldiers
Clear conditions     -All enemies defeated
Game Over conditions -Run out of time
                     -Death of all party members

Once the timebar at the top of the screen starts, move up north. You can try
to defeat the monsters, but if time is running out, escape by leaving Wendy
and move Merklich to the next screen. Once you reached the main screen where
the 4 Fomeros and Hingistan soldiers are positioned for truce guarding,

Clear conditions     - Defeat all imposter soldiers
Game Over consitions - All party members eliminated
                     - Fomeros soldiers attacked by the imposters
                     - Hingistan soldiers attacked by the imposters
                     - Party discovered by the actual soldiers
                       (they are represented by green dots on radar)

All 4 actual soldiers are not facing each other now, you can have Merklich and
Wendy run in between the barricades they've set up to separate themselves. Due
to the mist, they should not discover you unless you show up right to their
faces. Head west and wander around there or wait as you wish. Remember to
press select to bring up the radar if you accidentally turned it off. Keep
waiting till red dots emerge and rush off to ambush them. If any start to run
east, you must have Merklich block their way and attack them. Once all 6 are
dead,

Clear conditions     - Merklich and Wendy escaped via the east side of map
Game Over conditions - All party members eliminated
                     - Party discovered by the actual soldiers
                       (they are represented by green dots on radar)

Here, all you need is to run back east, same as when you passed through them
the first time, if one side is stirred up by the fight, you'll have to incline
more towards the side where the 2 soldiers are still facing the original
direction. As usual, the uber useful right analogue stick helps in spotting
which.

Once you reach the eastern end, it's finished.


[Mission complete possibilites] - Ambushed enemies as soon as they appear
                                - Did not let enemies go further than where
                                  they pop up

+=+=+=+=+=+=+

-Go back to Shizaaz
-Talk to man at speedboat, attempt to walk to village entrance
-Board speedboat to head back to Makinus
-Follow Wendy to the library, 8th Floor, talk with people in the building
-Go down and out of Monopolis building to dormitory building to the left
-Talk to dormitory reception person and use Identification Card
-Go right and rest
-Wake up, go left out and to 10th Floor again and get [Rare item: Artifact

-Talk and follow Wendy into the ship quarters
-Explore the ship and talk to the people, especially Shuweizer, Wendy and
 the helmsman
-Ask helmsman 'When will we reach'
-*Try to go down to ship quarters and...

*There are some variations here in my plays, basically asking the helmsman
the question is the main triggering point, but the below mission can start
immediately when Merklich enter the quarters or it only happen after he woke
up the next day.

Location             : Aboard Monopolis ship
Usable Characters    : Merklich, Wendy
Recommended Level    : 7-8
Enemies              - 3 Pawn Screepers
                     - 1 Rook Screeper
                     - 1 Bishop Screeper

Clear conditions     - All enemies defeated
Game Over conditions - All party members eliminated
                     - Death of Shuweizer

Leave the Rook and Pawn Screeper that emerged on Shuweizer's side to him, no
matter what the game over conditions say, Shuweizer will most likely be the
last to die in this battle. Have Merklich and Wendy concentrate on the other
2 Pawn Screepers to the right side. Hammer with your normal attacks or magic.
Heal if needed. It will take some amount of time, but no accidents should
happen. Once 3 units of screepers are gone, the Bishop Screeper will pop in to
end the fight, mission's done.

[Esgrenz Part 1] main story events:

Merklich woke up at Lenock Research center only to have most of his memory
lost. He met Anita who seems to know him but did not say any much more.
After that, he met Wendy who mistook him for the Leader of the Monopolis Red
Wolf army, Shuweizer. The real Shuweizer appeared and declare both of them
members of his Red Wolf army. At the Monopolis building at Makinus, both
were introduced to Shayer, executive serving the Monopolis president. Their
first mission is to take part in ambushing the rumored terrorists hideout at
the town of Datis along with other Monopolis guards. In the end, both of them
got the job somewhat done with the help of Shuweizer and discovered the
terrorist's plans to disguise as Fomeros and Hingistan soldiers to attack the
real ones in order to end the truce between the 2 countries.

Merklich and Wendy managed to put a stop to that but in the end the peace
meeting did not happen because one of the representatives were killed.
Meanwhile, news were going around that the barrier on the sealed continent has
been lifted. Merklich and Wendy were given a secret mission by Shayer, who
mentioned that it's a direct mission given by the president to use the
artifact sensor to search for energy reaction more than 100, or size more
than 100m. On their way to the originally sealed continent which they name as
Goat Land, there were attacks by strong water creatures called screepers and
the battle resulted in disaster.

Have Merklich run up to the young man(Rukias) and give him directions, which
is up to you, but having him follow Merklich is a good choice. You should
probably get rid of the Lv 9 monsters after you have Rukias with you. The
terrorist leader will escape, and there's pretty much no way for you to kill
him. You can try if you wanna though(it is possible), just have Merklich run
up and block his escape route south before you kill off any of his
subordinates. Otherwise, you probably should just leave him alone and
concentrate on the rest then finally the Pawn Screeper. Once again, the
screeper takes some time to kill, be patient and the mission should be
completed soon.

This can be a lil difficult if your levels are too low. To prevent too much
trouble, balance healing with attacks and as usual aim for the priest and
magic class enemies first. Give the 2 NPCs instruction to head for the tunnel
first, they may get attacked a few times but will be safe once they exit the
screen. Keep up the good HP and prevent too much Weaken spells from the enemy
magic users and you should be able to kill them all off soon.

straight for Irist, but that's not a very good idea with everyone attacking
you and healing her. But it's really up to you. Just take note that she can
use Holy Cross. The moment she falls, mission's finished.

Defeating Shuweizer seems easier, but it's really up to you. Note that he is
pretty strong and likes to use Critical Strike which minus around 100HP or so
off. Always keep a watchful eye on the HP of the Potrad people and heal them
if necessary. The infantry guards will spread out and attack the Potrads one
on one, making it quite impossible to block off all of them with 3 characters.
You'll just have to pick which ones you are gonna protect first if you are
aiming to finish the mission through defeating >5 guards. As usual, it would
be better to kill off the priest and magic class guards first. When you have
met either Clear condition, Shuweizer orders a full retreat.

Shuweizer will escape, don't bother about him. After a short while, the

warp, they will pop up at the lower left of the screen), they can use pretty
strong magic, try not to let them pull off too many. This is a rather easy

For this area, have Merklich standby at a green door and Rukias/Wendy at the
other and have the remaining character go near the light orb on the wall.
After that, immediately attack any enemies that appear. Command the character
with the light absorbed from the orb to whichever door you wanna open.

Do not let the character with the absorbed light attack enemies nor let
him/her be attacked by any enemy, or else the light will return back to the
orb. One of the doors lead to the upper floor. Once that door is gone,

appear while commanding Rukias and Wendy to move to the R and B positions.
Only when BOTH the red and blue door 1 comes in contact with the respective
color lights absorbed by the characters then will the entire door disappear.

Just like before, don't allow them to attack or be attacked or else you have
to start all over again. Once red+blue door 1 is taken care of(enemies will no
longer appear at door 1), tackle door 2 in the same manner.

[Goat Land Part 1] main story events:

Merklich woke up at the beach of a village named Wartree in the Goat Land and
met a fairy named Yurry. Yurry called him her master and explained that they
drifted onto the beach after the screeper attack. Shuweizer gave an order to
Merklich and Wendy to go to a town called Guylanuck. On their way there, the
two saw big creatures flying in the sky, and Yurry explained that those are
Queen Screepers, there used to be only 1 Queen Screeper and it was defeated,
but that caused a diverse reaction spread in which the scattered body pieces
transform and multiply, thus the number of Queen Screepers increased instead.
It was also mentioned later on that a city named Zeldock has been eliminated
with one blast from one of those Queen Screepers.

Then, the two met a young man named Rukias and the latter asked to travel
together for a while since it's safer. At Guylanuck, Merklich and Wendy met
other fairies as well as the red-eyed Grangeil general named Gyaricke. The
Monopolis is trying to sell to Grangeil their specially cultivated product:
the Pollumina trees, short form for Pollution Elimination trees which keep
out screepers with their fragrance. The Potrad objected because the trees are
gathering energy from the ground for such purpose and is a heavy burden on the
world. Gyaricke thought that it's good to have something to keep away the
screepers but couldn't agree because of what the Potrad said.

Yurry told the group about an ancient powerful weapon called the Admonisher,
but even that could not kill the Queen Screeper. She also mention Corin's
master, named Zeonsilt who did manage to defeat that original Queen Screeper
in the end.

Shuweizer left, and the group sensed a weird feeling, and after looking
around, realised that Gyaricke has disappeared with a Grangeil soldier
saying that a man named Zeakvalt has killed Gyaricke and Loofass(generals of
Grangeil, and called 'Slayers' due to their ability to defeat a screeper one
on one). It was also said that Zeakvalt was the one who defeated the Queen
Screeper. Outside the city, the Queen Screepers in the sky disappeared.

The group was shocked at the change in history which only they can sense and
know but was ordered by Shayer to escort Monopolis personnel to a city named
Felmentia in the Sheriltia territory. Along the way, they met a woman with
different color in each eye named Iristelessa(who were acting together with a
group called the Resistance, Land's Prayer) who called Merklich 'Brave Guard'.

At Felmentia, the group met another fairy who inform Yurry that Sheris, the
princess and only Slayer in Sheriltia was killed by Zeakvalt. Monopolis
persons try to sell Pollumina to the Sheriltia soldiers, but was greatly
opposed by the Potrads due to the same reasoning of the land's energy being
absorbed. Shuweizer expressed displease. The group sensed another similar
feeling as when back in Grangeil and discover the Potrads gone.

At the Potrad village, they got to know that the tribe was massacred 1 month
ago, and after some conversations, it was concluded that Shuweizer has the
ability to travel through time. Using a time distortion warp still remaining
in the village to go back to 1 month ago, the group succeeded in stopping
Shuweizer and history from being changed. They also discovered that Shuweizer
is after the Dragon orb and it is most likely still in Kytheris Island, where
Zeakvalt died fighting the Queen Screeper. However they were too late and
Shuweizer made off with the Dragon Orb as well as the Admonisher belonging to
the Peace Maintainence Army and travelled in the direction of Hingistan,
Esgrenz.

You are supposed to trigger the various switches to set the electric flow to
the Condenser for both this floor and the floor above, there are various ways.
The main thing is to take note that the switches work like toggle switches, so
pulling back or forth it will only cause the flow to go in 2 different ways
(look at the direction of the arrows) respectively.

For this floor, one way is to: pull switch at 2 lamp switch in the middle, and
the 2 lamp switch in the northern room. Go up the other floor, pull rightmost

                       before reaching the mountain top
                     - All party members eliminated

There are 2 screens to pass through before you reach the mountain top, it's
really up to you how you wanna go about doing this. Of course you should
move Merklich and let him run like mad past the 2 screens while the rest
heal and kill those Fomeros soldiers blocking his way. You ONLY need to bring
Merklich to the next screen. The treasure chests in the first screen can be
opened, but the ones in the 2nd screen cannot be reached for now, leave them.
In case ya wondering, there are no special items in them, just things you can
buy anywhere. And keep elimination to the minimum. If you want the experience
points, the monsters around the area can give you as and when you wish to,
don't risk it in a mission.

Once you reach the mountain top, conditions changes a bit:

Clear conditions     - After Wellber appear, go down the mountain
Game Over conditions - Death of Hofman
                     - Defeat more than 35 Fomeros soldiers 
                     - All party members eliminated

The main thing is to defeat around 15 of the Fomeros soldiers here, NOT
including those you killed on the way up. Each time you defeat an enemy, the
counter will be shown to you. It won't take long when the conditions change
again:

Clear conditions     - Destroy the lift
                     - After Wellber appear, go down the mountain
Game Over conditions - Death of Hofman
                     - Defeat more than 35 Fomeros soldiers
                     - All party members eliminated

Go and destroy the lift, one hit is enough and the conditions change back
to the previous one. Soldiers will keep popping up every now and then, if you
did not kill too much on your way up, it should be fine. Obviously, the Power

[Esgrenz Part 2] main story events:

The group reaches Esgrenz and halfway through, they met a man by the name of
Hofman who is helping out a merchant attacked by terrorists. At the Leystan
town in Hingistan, truth is revealed to Merklich that he is the Brave Guard
whose mission is to protect the spirit maiden. And the woman they met before
named Iristelessa is that maiden.

It was said that 2000 years ago, there appeared Infinitor, and because it's
powerful and of spirit form, there's no way to destroy it. The spirit maiden
managed to seal the Infinitor's soul inside the Dragon Orb, and every 200
years the next spirit maiden will have to go over to the Goat Land and
strengthen the seal. In her journey, the Brave Guard will put his life at
stake to protect her. In those days whereby the Goat Land's barrier was
still present, an item called the Barrier Breaking Ring was used so she can
enter Goat Land.

It was said that the village where the spirit maiden and Brave Guard were
was attacked by Monopolis troops and both the spirit maiden and Brave Guard
disappeared.

After the conversation, Yurry foresee the Admonisher shooting and killing
many Fomeros and Hingistan soldiers at Jant Mountain. She predicted it to
happen at sunset next day. The group decided to prevent that from happening
and came up with the plan to have soldiers from both sides retreat and leave
the mountain. Wendy offered to take care of things on the Hingistan side while
Merklich and Rukias asked Hofman to help them.

Hofman was originally a lieutanent of the Fomeros army, however because his
older brother is one of the candidates to the Chief's elections, thus he was
used to be involved in a scandal to affect his brother's election and is now
a wanted man. Hofman knew the man in charge of the Fomeros soldiers on Jant
Mountain is Wellber, who is the one who set him up and will desire more than
nothing to capture him. Making use of this, he devised a plan to let himself
be a bait to lure Wellber and the Formeros soldiers on Mount Jant to chase
after him and trek down the mountain. The plan succeeded, and the Admonisher's
shooting did not happen.

However, one of the powerful ancient weapon owned by Hingistan -named 'Giant'-
fell into Monopolis hands and together with the Admonisher, sets off in the
direction of Goat Land.

At the screen with 4 color lamps and buttons, make it so that all 4 shine at
the same time. The yellow and blue lamp controls are broken for the machine
while the red and green are non-functional for the ones on the wall. One
simple way is to make it so that the lamps shine yellow+blue and green+red
alternately. Wait for the yellow+blue combination and quickly choose to light
the red and green lamps on the MACHINE or wait for the green+red combination
and quickly choose to light the blue and yellow lamps on the WALL. Once done,
head through the unlocked door and continue the path. See a short
conversation, you are supposed to just attack the walls(now you may not
believe me but attacking a stopping block -be it door or walls- seems to have
become a trend in Growlanser), but Ruin Guards will appear. They are on the
upper platforms only reachable with attacks by Rukias/magic(but make sure you
manually direct Rukias movement route otherwise he may get stuck at the
compartment walls and unable to carry out the command to attack because his
attack range may not be that long), you can have one as healer while the
remaining 2 break down the walls or whatever you want. Once the last wall is
down, go and press the switch on the upper left wall. New enemies won't come
in anymore, kill whatever is remaining. Save and and go north.

Clear conditions     - Obtain Neara Powder and escape from this floor
                     - Defeat Mech Serpent
Game Over conditions - All party members eliminated

This can be a frustrating battle if you don't know the trick. I hope you 
already know that if there are 2 or more conditions for clear/game over,
meeting just one will trigger the clear/game over. Therefore in this case,
you can choose to do either to clear the mission.

Each color sphere is the key to unlock the respective colored doors, you
need to defeat them to access the treasure chests. The Neara Powder is in the
room on the right(purple).

The mech serpent will use Beam often which sends a shockwave in a straight
direction. Don't attack it until the barrier is gone. Incidentally, the
barrier is set up by the purple sphere, so aim for it first no matter which
clear condition you want to strive for.

As to fighting the spheres, they will move about which render most single
target magic useless, still time magic such as Blast, Flare and Blizzard
works, but that's just a waste of time and energy since they hit off as much
HP as your normal physical attacks. The deal here is to manipulate the
positions of your characters and the spheres(concentrate on one at a moment)
so that when the serpent uses Beam, it not only hits whoever is the character
it aims at, but also the sphere. One hit takes off more than half of the
sphere's HP. Also, since the each sphere will only travel in a straight line
to and fro in a fixed region, you can have characters block their travel paths
so you don't have to chase them up and down. Make full of use these
information and this mission will be really easy.

You can aim for Shuweizer first, when he is defeated he drops the Penetration
Gem. Equip it on your melee character, this will increase damage to the
screepers by 2 to 3 times(10-20HP instead of 5-10). If you did not get rid of
Shuweizer first, you will need to keep a watch on the Mutant Screeper, because
when it is dead, there's nothing there to protect Zeonsilt. Defeat Shuweizer's
group(if you defeat Shuweizer, his entire group will exit, reason being one
you will know later on in the game) will prompt the mutant screeper to urge
the party to fight screepers near it, thus increasing the damage dealt(you'll
also know why is it so much later in the game if you haven't played V)

This is a rather straightforward battle, and unless you messed up big time,
there's no chance of game over.

[Goat Land Part 2] main story events:

Back at Goat Land, Yurry got another premonition of the deaths of a huge
amount of people, and a while later, the group sensed a huge explosion south,
in the direction of Felmentia. Upon reaching there, they hear that the
congregation of small countries located south of Sheriltia has been eliminated
in the explosion. Chriass does not think the Admonisher can be that
devastating and Wendy explained that it may be the explosion of the Giant(used
as a bomb) caused by overwhelmed energy to its power furnace from the
Admonisher. 

Yurry believed that the tragedy can be prevented by looking for the time
distortion warp at Wartree. Her reasoning comes from the original history
whereby it's Zeonsilt who defeated the Queen Screeper, and in that history,
the Admonisher was destroyed in the process of resistance against the Queen
Screeper. If the group can change the history back to the original, the
Admonisher would not exist by now and thus the earlier explosion can be
avoided. In this current history, Zeonsilt died before he joined the Peace
Maintainence Army(he was killed by Shuweizer), therefore if the group can go
back and save him in time, the original history will be reverted back.

However, if the original history is returned, the risk of the Queen Screepers
will return as well. The group asked the Potrad village chief how did Zeakvalt
managed to defeat the Queen Screeper without it multiplying(in the current
history) and learnt that it can be done with a specific barrier laid out at
the correct timing when the Queen Screeper is defeated. To exert that barrier,
the Absorbing Slab is needed. The Potrad can make them if they have Neara
Powder.

Having learnt from Randy(who studies deep in ancient technology and ruins)
about the ancient battleship in the village of the Dragon Orb protectors,
the group managed to get the Neara Powder and in turn obtained the Absorbing
Slabs. At Wartree, Yurry connected the time distortion warp and the group
travelled back to when Zeonsilt was still alive. They succeeded in saving him.
Thereafter, with the help of the fairies, they went back to the time during
Zeonsilt's fight with the Queen Screeper and set up the slabs on Kytheris
Island. A mechanized human named Neilis appeared to try and stop them but
failed. In the end, the barrier was activated and the Queen Screeper is gone
for good.

Up next is to locate the Dragon Orb, and with information and help from
Zeonsilt and Chriass, the party arrived at the Admonisher crash site but only
to have Shuweizer ahead of them. In their chase, they saw the spirit maiden
Iristelessa and some Resistance soldiers fighting against Shuweizer to get
the Dragon orb. Despite help from Neilis, Shuweizer lost and retreated.

Irist examined the Dragon Orb and mention that as expected, the Infinitor is
no longer sealed in the Orb and explained that it is due to the previous 2
spirit maidens unable to carry out their mission of strengthing the seal every
200 years = total 400 years. Looking at the Barrier Breaking Ring Neilis
dropped, it is concluded Neilis to be the one who prevented them from doing
so, since through the use of the ring, she had access to the Goat Land even
when the barrier around the continent existed. 

Irist elaborated further on her mission to seal the Infinitor back in and
revealed that there is no way to defeat the Infinitor who is in spirit form
and acts by moving from one body host to the next. She requested help from
the group to approach the current host body of the Infinitor and allow her to
perform her sealing technique, and that is Brandole, president of Monopolis.
The technique requires Irist to sacrifice her life to succeed and it is likely
that when the Infinitor is sealed in the Dragon Orb, the real Brandole won't
live anyway.

come in from the right. Unless you are very fast in killing whatever is on the
screen, otherwise you'll have to opt for the escape condition. We can kill 30
guards if we want, but the thorn lies in the time limit. Don't worry too much
about pride, have everyone escape after Irist to finish this.

Make sure the NPCs don't die, because you need them to guard the other 2
ladders which lead to the hideout. This pretty much tells you that while
having multiple entrances and exits can serve good as part of a decoy plan,
don't make so many that you can't cope with them. After you defeat all
soldiers on the side where you are guarding, you can help out the NPCs with
theirs. But leave at least one person there because later on, enemies will
come in from the western side using diving tools to pass through the waters.

After some time, the king of impersonation will emerge, and run over to the
upper left screen to open the lock. Another condition will be added that you
can't have him killed. Have characters block the enemy advance and once he
has unlock the panel, it is possible to have your characters escape and once
all have done so, end.

This mission can take quite some time. First off, make sure you move your
characters as close to the enemies as possible without being discovered. When
the battle finally start, you might want to move Wendy to the captain along
with Merklich for her little side event. Once you are near him, he will start
to run to the Giant to request activation, make sure you kill him before he
does that(use your slep's blood to block his advance), else it's game over.
After that, you can concentrate on killing the remaining enemies. Once the
screen is cleared, done.

The energy supplier on each side(the things that looked like pillars in the
middle of the screen) requires you to have one character go near it to switch
it off. Though there's a time limit here, it should not be too much of a
problem. Once you have switched off both, you have to go switch off the
devices on both ends of the screen. The same theory applies, you might want to
split your party into 2. But it's your call. Once everything is switched off
and firing status stopped, mission is finished.

The main issue here is the barrier. Switching off both will cause the third
one to go down as well. However, after 1-2 turns or so, all of them will be
reactivated, make you don't get all your characters trapped somewhere in
between. Have a magic user remain at the bottom to undo the barriers when
necessary while you move the rest up to attack/use surround magic. The device
key is with the captain. Once you get the device key, use it on the shiny
area. This mission is easy to get over with, provided you know what you are
doing.

The activation is actually attached with a time counter, putting a limit to
how long you are given to defeat Irist. There's really no point in trying to
kill all enemies(unless you want a mc, look below) if you are not able to,
just clear enough so that your characters don't get dragged into the long ATW
gauge and faint disaster. Shuweizer is pretty strong as usual, make sure you
keep an eye on whom is his target. Mission ends once Irist's HP becomes 0.

Have Rukias and Wendy kill off the 2 archers at the entrance gate. After that,
move them to the left part of the screen. To prevent more than 5 guards dead,
you can have both defend/heal. Once all guards are gathered around them, have
Merklich round up from the right and past the gate. Take note that you can
have Merklich use items and status magic on Wendy/Rukias and not be spotted.

Game Over conditions - Discovered by guards

Move Merklich past the guards and go into the medical room(at the upper right
of the screen). I can't really tell you a specific way because they walk
around, you just have to hide Merklich in the trees as much as you can and
try to keep a finger's length away from them, and if possible keep out of
their sight. I think they play too much Tenchu. But it's pretty easy to pass
through this, don't worry too much. Yurry will give a warning if you are too
near, so it shouldn't be problem.

Once inside, talk to the doc to get [Rare item: Prison Key] and [Rare item:
Time Travel Medicine]. Exit and go into the center via the door to the left.
Go down the stairs to where Anita is and use the key on the door. With Anita,
it will be a lil more difficult to leave the screen without having to keep an
eye on her movements. Once you make it past west, you'll enter the 2nd part of
the mission.

At this screen, either you are very good or lucky, otherwise there's no way to
get past this screen without being discovered, and when someone spots you,

Clear conditions     - Have Merklich escape after party members

Game Over conditions - Any party member eliminated

You can now control Anita, go ahead and command your characters to escape in
in whichever direction you want. As mentioned in the conditions, the escape
destination must be the same. Since Rukias's MOV stat is higher(by right), I
would suggest you have them escape via the route nearer to Wendy. But it's
really up to you. Once everyone is out of the screen, have Merklich escape
as well.

P/S: In one of my replays, I've had the captain approach Anita and recognizing
her from Lenocks and attempting to run off to pass on the alert, thus popping
up a new clear condition which is to escape only after the captain is dead. To
avoid that, keep her away from the captain.

Have someone kill the priest and magic class soldiers first. Well that's what

is most probably the most difficult Shuweizer battle because his attacks and
critical hits can deplete even Merklich's HP bar pretty fast and cause stun.
Always have someone ready to heal. Once Shuweizer falls, mission is done.

##############################################################################

[Esgrenz Part 3] main story events:

The group attempted to escort Irist to seal the Infinitor. However, in the
1500 years, the Infinitor managed to come up with a method to render the
spirit maiden's sealing technique useless. The group escaped from Makinus with
the seriously injured Irist and head on to the hideout of the Resistance Army.

There, they met Maxwell, leader of the army as well as Wendy's brother. It was
made known that Wendy is the 3rd princess of Hingistan and Maxwell being the
2nd son of the king. As Hingistan continue to grow and expand, many ideals
were changed. The heavy taxes forced on the citizens as well as the direction
the country was heading to made Maxwell very unhappy as only a small portion
of the people in Hingistan are living rich, full lives and the rest of the
neighbouring countries are already adopting democratic measures to improve the
lives of their citizens. Therefore he left the family and later on set up the
Resistance group. Wendy, on the other hand, joined Monopolis to find out about
her brother's whereabouts. She told Maxwell about the death of their older
brother Gilum, after which many important country responsibilities came into
the hands of the minister Zafreed. Zafreed not only impose heavy taxes, he
forced marriage upon the princess.

Maxwell then elaborated on the Brave Guard who died protecting him and Irist
while they were escaping. It seems that all Brave Guard have the same looks.
During the attack on the village by Monopolis, it was likely that they made
off with the pod Merklich was in. Wendy assumed that the reason why Merklich
has no memories is because he has just awakened and really has none to begin
with.

The group then went to rest and Merklich had a short dream about a man who
looked like him preparing for battle with Neilis. When the group woke up, they
realized that the hideout has been attacked by Monopolis soldiers. Leaving
Irist with Maxwell, the 3 escaped from the hideout only to hear news that
Irist has been captured by Shuweizer. They rush off to Shizaaz and met Hofman.
Despite history being changed in terms of Hofman's knowledge of Admonisher,
the event of the Merk's party fighting on Jant mountain remains, only that
they were fighting to rescue Hofman, therefore Hofman still recognize
Merklich and Rukias and informed them that the Monopolis army brought tents
and supplies with them, therefore it's unlikely they plan to return to the
base any moment.

The group then rest at the inn and woke up to Fomeros soldiers declaring
Shizaaz as their frontline war base due to Hingistan bringing out the weapon
Giant located at Jant mountain. With the help of Hofman, they managed to
drive away the Fomeros soldiers and decided to try and put a stop to the
Giant before it's too late. The attempt was successful, but as they leave the
Giant, the Monopolis army arrived along with Shuweizer and Iristelessa.

Apparantly Maxwell was taken as hostage and thus Iristelessa had to do what
Shuweizer tells her to: use the Dragon Orb's energy to power up the Giant.
After a failed attempt, Shuweizer and Iristelessa retreated. The group went
back to Leystan only to receive information that Maxwell committed suicide at
Yarstill barrack where he was imprisoned after being captured by Monopolis
army. Miranda told Yurry that without Maxwell, the world will meet its end.
Therefore the group decided to go back to the past to rescue Maxwell. However,
since the last attempt to travel back time to seal the Queen Screeper has
sapped up too much energy from the fairies, it is impossible to do it a 2nd
time.

After some searching, the group was told that Shuweizer have had an operation
done on him that allows him to travel through time, and that there is another
girl at Lenocks who went through the same surgery. Merklich managed to rescue
the girl Anita, who revealed that Shuweizer is her older brother and she was
the first to be experimented on the time travel ability. The successful
results were then operated on Shuweizer. Therefore while Shuweizer can use
the ability freely, Anita needs to take medication to prevent too much burden
on her body when using the technique.

SHe added that to change events by going back to the past is usually very
difficult alone, therefore an experiment is done on Merklich so as to enable
the person to bring along followers: the crystal which is implanted within
Wendy and which Rukias obtained from the dying monopolis soldier in Goat Land,
thus explaining why both of them can return to the past with Merklich.

Anita went on to explain the various principles regarding time travel. First
being that one can only return to the same place and time era once. It is only
possible to go back the number of years corresponding to the person's age, in
other words, someone aged 20 years old can only travel as far back to 20 years
ago only. However, if one of the persons he/she brought along is older, for
example 40 years old, then they can go back as far as 40 years. Lastly, when
a person travels back time, his/her presence there is considered a fake
existence.(As an example, if Merklich travel back 10 years ago, he must not
interact with the Merklich during that time, else he will get absorbed and
become one with that Merklich)

With the help of Anita, Maxwell was rescued and the group went on to help
Iristelessa at the Monopolis building. There, they realized that Shuweizer
is also attempting to put a stop to Infinitor in his own ways and if the group
can defeat him, he will work with them. The group did win the battle and
Shuweizer kept his promise of lending a hand, he further explained that the
Infinitor has 4 Energy Towers(refer to Section C for explanation) built to
suck up energy from the land. They are built on points through the dragon vein
where the energy of the land gather and balance each other. Therefore if one
tower is destroyed, the system becomes unstable, function wildly and energy
will overrun and the world will be eliminated. However, if the remaining 3
towers can be destroyed within 3 hours after the first, that can be prevented.
Nevertheless, it is impossible to do that, not even with the Hingistan Giant.

Before more strategies can be proposed, Neilis suddenly appear and attacked
Shuweizer, referring anyone with time travel ability a threat to Infinitor.
Unable to avoid in time, Shuweizer died.

Game Over conditions - More than 3 Resistance members killed
                     - All party members eliminated

The main idea here is to first get rid of 20 enemy soldiers, or at least clear
the ones who are already on the screen(they will keep coming in). You should
have one character as a healer and chant Grow related magic. As for the
offensive side, Earthquake and Meteor work wonders, do abuse them a lot. Once
the counter reaches 20, make sure the screen is somewhat clear of enemies,
then talk to any of the Resistance member and tell them to advance forward.
If the progress is fine, the enemy will feel threatened and send a signal
asking for reinforcements.

Clear conditions     :Merklich escape after Resistance army members
Game Over conditions -More than 3 Resistance members killed

Block off the enemies until the resistance members have escaped, then command
your characters to the lower right exit. Once everyone reach there, it's done.
You can move Merk to the end of the screen without your other characters to
end the mission.

Use magic or have Rukias/Irist to attack the switches. When the switches are
destroyed, there won't be any reinforcements coming in, and the clear 
condition is to get rid of all enemies remaining on screen. It's not really
that difficult since you've got Maxwell helping out at well. If you can afford
to, Earthquake and Meteor will end things faster. Once all enemies are gone,
mission is finished.

Clear conditions     - Defeat Zafreed
Game Over conditions - All party members elminated

Zafreed will be protected by a barrier which is maintained by the magic users.
In order to touch him, you will need to get rid of all 6 of them. Thankfully,
while the barrier is up, Zafreed won't do anything. I would not suggest using
meteor and other powerful magic here, they take too long to chant for this
situation.

The magic users are the dangerous ones here, 'cause if you leave them be, you
can have 6 Lv 3 Meteor falling on your characters consecutively. Each takes
off around 100-150HP, plus the attacks from the infantry...well, I don't think
all your characters have 800HP each, take note of that and press the Triangle
button often and use items to heal. You should spread your characters out as
much as possible anyway. Once the barrier is down, Zafreed will start to chant
magic. This is probably the best time to focus all attacks on him, even if you
can't get rid of any other remaining enemies. FYI, Zafreed uses Lv 7 Blast and
Lv 3 Earthquake a lot. Once he goes down, it's finally finished.

##############################################################################

[Esgrenz Part 4] main story events:

Anita became the new president of Monopolis with news spreading that it is due
to Shuweizer being sick and unable to manage Monopolis matters. Rukias located
Hofman, and together all of them discussed more on the Energy Towers. 1 is in
Fomeros, 2 in Hingistan and 1 in Goat Land. Help from Hingistan and Fomeros
is needed, therefore the first thing to do is to end the war between the 2
countries.

Hofman elaborated on the Fomeros side, saying that the Chief's election is
coming in half a month's time. The 2 main candidates are Guryme and Daytlich.
The former is very ambitious and insistent in battling against Hingistan while
the latter is pretty much against war. As candidates, both have their scandals
as tripping blocks. For Guryme, it was said he is making the army his personal
property and using it for his own goals. As for Daytlich, it's Hofman.

Hofman was one of the guards in the No.32 supply group led by Wellber. To set
Hofman up, Wellber sent a false message using Hofman's name to the Hingistan
soldiers telling them to attack the No.32 supply group camp and make off with
the specified supplies while he excused himself in that time period. After a
fierce battle, only Hofman survived(which Wellber predicted). Wellber then
returned and accused Hofman of secretly providing supplies to Hingistan, proof
being the fake letter and the supply boxes which were empty right from the
beginning.

If Hofman can avoid being caught and find evidence to prove his innocence, 
the fake scandal will be gone, and if his brother wins the election, the
Fomeros army will most likely stop fighting against Hingistan. With that,
the group attempted to locate the evidence in Royferon and discovered many
wooden boxes of supplies in the black market, Having taken note of the codes
on the boxes and matching them with the delivery documents, the commander
of the Fomeros military base affirmed that they were all under Guryme's name,
supposed to be delivered to the camp. This managed to prove that Guryme and
Wellber are the ones who are making profits out of the army's supplies. With
that, Daytlich won over much votes and emerged victorious in the election.

After completing the task at Fomeros, the group travelled to Hingistan and
met up with Wendy. On the Hingistan side, as mentioned by Maxwell and Wendy
before, Zafreed's methods are oppressing the citizens. The group joined up
with the Resistance army to start up a revolution and succeeded in taking
down Zafreed and Maxwell started up a committee to revise the kingdom's
approach towards political and internal matters. 

When the group returned to Makinus, they entered into a battle with some
invading screepers. They wondered why the Pollumina trees aren't working to
keep out the screepers as Monopolis used to claim. After some discussions
and affirmation from Anita, they realized that the trees weren't used for
eliminating pollution and keeping out screepers. Instead, they sucked up
energy from the ground, as proved by examining one of the Pollumina fruit and
discovering that it contained only pure magical energy. Screepers were
biological weapons which the Infinitor used to slaughter humans, which also
implied that he can command them to not appear at locations where the
pollumina trees are located to give a false impression for monopolis claims.

Zeonsilt will do a lot of explanation here about his sound wave barrier
ability, if you did not play G5, the gist is that he can weaken screepers with
that and if you fight screepers within a fixed range near him, the damage done
is greatly increased. If you have Penetrating Gems equipped as well, this
battle is a real joke.

You can save a lot of trouble if you bring Zeonsilt with you. If not, the
main thing will still be to cure whoever is injured, especially the priest
class soldier at the south. The familiar red wolf member will appear out of
nowhere and help out as usual. If you have Anita with you, you can move her
near him to get a lil bit of idea of who he really is. After a short while,
the arch demon and its group appear at the south, once again your priest there
is a sitting duck. But overall, it's an easy battle(with Zeon).

I hope you have Zeon with you. More knights will come from below, and a bishop
as well. Have your characters block their advance, or at least the road to the

be quite a tedious battle without Zeon. But if you want the challenge, then
unequip the gems and go ahead and fight without him, defeat the bishop one on

At this point in time, you must go and finish Zeon's side quest(refer to the

-Choose characters for your party
-Go east through the open path
-The enemies on this screen do not have to be cleared
-Go north and enter the tower
-The enemies on this screen do not need to be cleared as well
-To open the middle door, have 2 characters go to the shiny lamps on both
 sides and choose to turn it off, when both are switched off, door opens
-Save(you can't leave until you finish this entire tower)
-Go up and left and up winding stairs

This mechanism is pretty simple to solve but hard to explain in words or
diagrams how to go about doing it, therefore I'm only gonna explain how it
works:

The shiny light blue warp only allows one person to warp. Some allow you to
warp back, some doesn't. So you'll have to see whether the wrap point you
used earlier is lighted or not. If not, you can't warp back. Switches on the
yellow circles will open some sliding doors. Each time you switch the yellow
circle, enemies will pop in from nowhere and the best approach is really to
kill them first before you continue solving the puzzle(if that can be
considered one). The right analogue stick is your friend, use it to check the
map layout.

-Once finished, go up the stairs.

A system which vomits out Elder Mechs continously. Look at the shiny switches,
the arrows will toggle back and forth between up and down. That's the
direction the mechs will go in. Mechs on one level won't continue down or up
to the other levels, make use of this info. Make sure your other characters
don't get trapped as well. This isn't a mission, don't waste resources here.
Simply have Merklich make it to the stairs that leads to the next screen is
sufficient.

This mission is the prime example of bad communication. The moment we stepped
into this tower, some smart ass already destroyed another tower. And in the
end, we are left with not 1 hour after all the climbing, but 16 miserable
turns to destroy the crystal. Having Rukias here is pretty good since he can
help out in attacking the guarder. The barrier protecting the crystal will go
down when the guarder is destroyed. But it will come back after a period of
time and you have to repeat the whole process of killing it to remove the
barrier.

When the guarder takes a hit and disappears, immediately use the right 
analogue stick to see which pod it goes to and move Merklich to attack it(use
Attack status magic on him beforehand) and so on. Well, that's one way, if
you have a better plan, good for ya. In terms of the crystal, don't use fire
related attacks/magic. Attack magic + Cycle Up + Critical Hit works best
because Critical Hit and related melee techniques stops time while characters
execute them. Make sure HP of your characters are always at least above 200,
because the crystal can use very high levels of Blast, Thunderstorm and
Earthquake. I've also seen it use Rust(a killer). When the HP bar of the
crystal drops to 0, it's over. I finished it with 11 turns remaining, thus it
shouldn't be a problem for you.

You have a time limit here, but it shouldn't pose too much of a problem. Look

side. Press one first, then immediately have your characters attack the device
from which those enemies emerge from. Once that is done, clear the screen of
enemies and repeat the same thing for the other switch. The barrier at the
lower left end of the screen will be lifted. Next screen, go west. Defeat the
2 enemies, examine the control panel at the lower right screen. Go back to
previous screen(save point won't allow you to save).

Remember the devices you destroyed earlier. There are similar ones on this
screen, choose 3 characters to stand by at those devices(whether you want
3 at one device or to spread them out is up to you). Have the remaining
character use the lighted warp point and trigger the switch. When one device
is gone, aim for the next until all 3 are non-functional before you take care
of the enemies. Once everything is finished, go lower right to next screen.

Clear conditions     - Destroy the Energy Devices and defeat Neilis

Since the enemies are gonna keep coming in unless you destroy those devices we
are so familar with from the past 2 screens, I'm not gonna list them in
details on the enemies info section above. As for the Energy Devices, you have
to destroy all 6 in the time limit. The way I do it is have 1 character take
care of the energy devices, 1 as healer and the remaining 2 to attack the
enemies. Neilis can use Earthquake and grow-healing, and she is quick with
her chanting. Once clear conditions are met, mission is over.

[Mission complete possibilites] - Destroyed energy devices, spawning devices,
                                  and defeated all other enemies before Neilis

I've played through this and the next battle sooo many times to get the
various endings as well as more on replays, thus making this real easy. Get
rid of the spawning devices first(just like previous battles), after that you
should aim to kill off some enemy soldiers and Neilis. Once done, shoot for
Brandole. Continue your attacks until he falls, then get rid of the remaining
enemies. If you don't defeat Brandole, the reinforcements won't stop even with
the spawning devices gone.

                                  defeated Brandole and finally eliminate the

Location             : Ancient Soaring Ship,  2000 years ago
Usable Characters    : Merklich, Wendy, Rukias, Irist, Hofman, Anita, Zeonsilt
                       (Choose 4)
Recommended Level    : 55
Enemies              - Infinitor Hibernating Capsule
                     - Lv 58 Guardian Cannons
                     - Invader army soldiers, Lv 59-61
NPCs                 : None
Clear conditions     - Defeat Infinitor
Game Over conditions - All party members eliminated

The last mission, and probably the hardest...if you are lost. The first form
is the capsule, which is the outer layer. It does not attack at all, you
should have your characters hit at the cannons first. Critical Hit and
related melee techniques are good. If you have Inferno, you might want to use
it, but wait till the enemy soldiers are surrounding the characters. Make sure
you are not using those characters for magic attacks/healer. It'll be good if
they have learnt the MP recovery skill.

Once both cannons are gotten rid of, aim to clear the enemy soldiers. If you
are quick enough, by the time one of your characters is unable to remain in
the fight, only the Infinitor is left on the screen. The character as
mentioned earlier will become an NPC and run up to where the Infinitor is and
and strike a final critical hit which takes off 500 HP from the outer layer
and surrounding enemies if there are any.

Now you only have 3 characters left. Continue your attacks on the outer layer.
Once you have taken off enough HP, it will be crushed and it's time for the
Infinitor's 1st form. The 1st form can use strong magic, and its physical
attacks take off at least 150 with each hit. There's also a healing unit
behind it which you must destroy no matter what. After that, you should have
the character whom you did not choose to get the ending for to throw the
strongest attacks, because after a certain amount of time, he/she will become
an NPC, run up to the Infinitor and strike a critical hit, taking 500 HP off
and exit from the battle.

**
P/S: I haven't derived at how they determine which character will leave the
battle first and so on. For my replays, I almost always use Merklich, Wendy,
Rukias and Zeonsilt. And unless I choose Zeonsilt as the character I wish to
get the ending for, he always ends up being the first to go. From that, I
believe the period of time that a character has been with Merklich throughout
the game is the main criteria. So the order will be something like:

Wendy->Rukias->Hofman->Irist->Anita->Zeonsilt. Therefore, say for example, you
chose Irist as the first character, then the remaining 2 to be Anita and
Wendy. Anita is likely to be the first to leave the battle, then Wendy. Though
I'm not sure whether the character relationship levels play a part of not.

**

If the battle progress is good, that critical hit should bring out the
Infinitor's 2nd and final form. Now you only have 2 characters left. This form
is like the previous, only that it doesn't need time to chant magic and shifts
around the screen after every few hits, once you see him disappear, spread
your 2 characters apart, because consecutive Flare Lv 9 throws can hurt big
time. Chanting healing magic here is a killer in my opinion, so I hope you
saved up on items usage earlier. Once again, if you still have some melee
attack skills left, use them. Keep up the attacks and item healing, soon the
Infinitor will die. Giving just 500+ EXP for all those trouble is just insane,
but it really doesn't matter anymore.

+=+=+=+=+=+=+

-Use the big warp point
-Walk back to the Clone Pod room and examine the control panel
-Watch cutscene
-For all the places the game brings Merklich to, explore around(it's optional)
 and leave

Once everything is done...

Congrats, you've beaten Growlanser VI: Precarious World.

[Finale] main story events:                                               [F1]

Having taken care of the war, the party can concentrate on the plan to destroy
the Energy Towers. They decided to start off with the one in Goat Land, and
travelled to the Peace Maintainance Army to bring up the matter to Chriass.
After hearing the situation, Chriass agreed to lend a hand and inform the
kingdoms of Grangeil and Sheriltia about the matter. At the same time, he
gave Zeonsilt(an experienced expert with screepers) a class S mission, that
is to assist Merklich and party. 

Back at the Monopolis building, Hofman mentioned that the Fomeros army will
take care of the tower on their side while Wendy added on that Maxwell and
his group will work on the one in Hingistan. The party is given the task to
destroy the last one, which they managed to after a tedious advance through
the tower.

Irist told the rest of the party that if the ancient soaring ship which is
currently submerged deep in the waters can be brought back up, the Infinitor
can be destroyed because she believed its physical body is located in the
ship. Though it was said earlier that the Infinitor is really of spirit
form, it wouldn't make sense for it to have to come to this continent 2000
years ago on a ship.

When the soaring ship came up to the surface due to Irist's efforts, the
group invaded it only to find the Infinitor using the energy gathered from the
Pollumina trees to go back to 2000 years ago in order to kill the first spirit
maiden, which will change history completely. With Anita's time travel
ability and Merklich being the clone of Commander 13(the one who used to work
for Infinitor but betrayed him 2000 years ago to fight on the spirit maiden's
side), the group was able to travel to 2000 years ago.

There, they helped out the spirit maiden and Commander 13 while the Infinitor
retreated back to its original body.

As for the rest, I won't spoil them for you.

---Questions and responses(in-game)---                                    [Q1]

This section will list the single-try(meaning you only get one chance to pick
your options) story and character questions and responses which I think may
affect:

1)Merklich's personality
2)How other characters think of him/the affection rating system

I decided to put this in a separate section instead of mixing them with the
walkthrough for easy reference since everything here is listed in descending
order in accordance to their occurance/timeline in the game. This also implies
that there will be a LOT of spoilers. Furthermore, I'll try to keep to a
translation that sticks completely to the original(sometimes even opting to
use a word-for-word style), but there may be cases whereby I will restructure,
summarise or even combine sentences to allow for better understanding.

You might want to read the few points below to have a better understanding of
how the personality and affection rating works:

-Grayed out options are affected by Merk's personality. In other words, if you
have been very consistent in choosing polite responses, it greatly increases
the chance of rude options being grayed out in future options picking.
-I believe that as with previous Growlansers, this game also uses the point
system which will gradually affect the affection ratings. Options are attached
with hidden + or - points.
-Using Dandy books increases Merk's charisma by a random amount of points. I
believe the points added will affect all of your playable characters.
-The options you choose throughout the game does NOT only affect the party
members who are with you, but also those who are not by your side at the
moment as well as characters who are going to BUT haven't joined you as a
playable character as yet. This is proven by me getting an immediate red
affection rating for Zeon the moment he joined my party.


An explanation of the format of the entire table goes like that of below:

==============================================================================
                           <Time period in game>
==============================================================================

<Location>
 ========

<Character>: <main speech/situation details>

<Various choices, the one marked with a * is the one I think is the most
appropriate>

<Explanation where deemed necessary>

==============================================================================


Items in () brackets are the situations or things you have to do to trigger
the conversations. In the case of party split conversations, I will use a
shorter line divider using '+' to separate the questions asked by various
characters.

P/S: Although I cannot give full assurance as to which choice is the best, but
I will indicate what I PERSONALLY think to be the more appropriate ones(a.k.a
the ones that are sound). Take note that my recommendations are WHOLLY my own
speculation. And that is why you don't need to follow mine if you think it's
not what you prefer to choose.

Now let's go on to the real thing.


==============================================================================
                            Prologue+Esgrenz Part 1
==============================================================================

 Nowhere
 =======


Lady with 2 different colored pupils: "...is it alright if you will let me
observe whether you are the person I'm looking for?"

1)I don't mind
2)*Not interested

Pick 1 to start the character making session. Pick 2 to skip right to the main
game.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Lenocks Research Center
 =======================

Doctor: "Do you remember your name?"

1)*Merklich
2).....

If you want to, pick 2 to go to the name changing screen again.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Doctor: "Any other apart from that?"

1)Don't remember
2)Speak randomly
3)*Try to recall

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Anita: "...as promised, tell me about the wide wound on your chest."

1)Ask her "What is it about a chest wound?"
2)*Ask her "Do you know me?"
3)Ignore her

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Anita: "...the next time you return here, you will be an enemy."

1)*Ask her why
2)Remain silent

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Wendy: "Are you the guard who was supposed to come and meet me? Shuweizer...
right?"

1)Yeah
2)*It's another person
3)Remain silent

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Wendy: "And you are?"

1)*Tell her your name
2)Don't tell her your name

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Wendy: "For that well-known person to make the effort to come and meet me..."

1)It's probably another guy with the same name
2)He's probably just dropping by on the way back or something like that
3)*Because Wendy is being selected to join the special unit
4)Remain silent

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Wendy: "I'm Wendy, you are?"

1)*Tell her your name
2)Don't tell her your name

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Wendy: "...they must be coming in from this direction..."

1)Ask her what is she talking about
2)*Agree with her
3)Remain silent

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Shuweizer: "...it seems as though you knew beforehand that it will happen...if
           there's anything, just say it."

1)I had a premonition about it
2)*I have been through it once
3)I saw it in a dream
4)Remain silent

I think the 2nd choice is the best choice, but it probably won't be treated as
though you are lying if you pick 1 or 3...especially when you don't know the
story plot as yet.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Makinus Area
 ============

Soldier exiting the elevator: "The truce between Fomeros and Hingistan is
great because then a private organisation like us don't need to cross over
past the dangerous borderline and things will still be fine."

1)Agree with him
2)*I don't think it will go smoothly
3)We will become jobless that way
4)Remain silent

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Wendy: "My goal in becoming a red wolf member has come true!"

1)I'm happy as well
2)I'm not
3)*Point out the mistake on how it should be 'my dream has come true'
4)Remain silent

As weird as it seems, 3 is the best choice in my opinion. It's sorta teasing
her since she's using the wrong words. Nevertheless, 1 is also pretty okay I
believe since that option may give a positive for Anita(who will become a
playable character later on) because you are saying that you are happy to be
part of Shuweizer's special unit.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Wendy: "Preparations done?"

1)*Yes
2)No

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Wendy: "...seems like I dropped them somewhere..."

1)Look at her indifferently
2)*Console her
3)Shocked

No matter which choice you pick, you get another set of options:

1)Continue to harp on it
2)*Let it go

2nd choice seems better but the 1st choice doesn't yield bad results either.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Dastis Area
 ===========

Wendy: "The trees are withered because of water pollution caused by industrial
waste from Dastis."

1)*Hear her out on the effects of the Pollumina trees
2)Remain silent

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Wendy: "Have you researched about Dastis?"

1)No
2)*Yes

Either one will give you another set of options.

1)*Don't scream out the name of our special unit
2)Remain silent

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Wendy: "Do you remember what is the name used in booking the room?"

1)Cat
2)*Rat
3)Bat
4)Don't remember

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Wendy: "I like cooking."

1)Surprised by the abrupt change in topic
2)Liking it doesn't mean being good at it
3)*Because you like it, you will become better
4)Though you are obsessed but you must be bad at it

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Wendy: "Sorry...I..."

1)Ask for a reason
2)*We should first concentrate on chasing after them
3)Remain silent and chase after those who have escaped

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Wendy: "Do you know anything from this note saying - library 4-2-B-133 - ?

1)*Yes
2)No

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-Choosing to examine the book-

1)Page 42 looks suspicious
2)Page 133 looks suspicious
3)Check out all of the pages
4)It has got nothing to do with this book

You can pick the 4th choice straightaway(which IMHO is the most accurate but 
Wendy will get somewhat frustrated though) so I'd suggest choosing any of the
other three options first.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

2)*Must be some kind of important mission
3)Do not reply

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Shuweizer: "Is it impossible for me to do it alone? Success in battles does
not always depend on the number of participants. If you are alone, you just
need to adopt a method that will bring you victory."

1)*The side which is not discovered by the enemy has the advantage
2)You just need to defeat the enemy general
3)Because you have the strength and abilities to fight on your own

5)Remain silent

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

be able to sell our company's products..."

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Wendy: "...Another continent huh...I wonder when will this mission end...?"

1)*What's wrong?
2)You hate it?
3)You don't wish to leave this continent?

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Wendy: "I wonder whether it's dangerous or not and what will happen there."

1)I'm worried as well
2)If we got attacked, we just need to defeat the enemies
3)*Can't be helped even if you are worried about it

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Aboard ship
 ===========

-Party splits-

(Talk to Wendy)
Wendy: "Is there a reason why they use such an old type of boat?"

1)*Answer her
2)I don't know
3)Remain silent

Choosing 1st choice will open up another set of options:

1)There are not enough boats
2)High speed boats are only suitable for short travelling distances
3)*To match the civilization level to that of the destinated continent

                                 +++++++++++++++++

(Talk to Shuweizer)
Shuweizer: "Do you understand what your mission is about?"

1)*Yes
2)No

Choosing 1st choice will open up another set of options:

1)Serve as bodyguards for the company's personnel

3)*To search for reactions to the sensor



(Talk to Wendy again after the 10 days)
Wendy: "A lil bit of my memory is unstable as well."

3)Remain silent

==============================================================================

 Wartree
 =======

Yurry: "Is everything alright?"

1)*It's fine
2)It hurts
3)Who are you
4)What is this place

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Guylanuck area
 ==============

Terrorist: "Damn, this monster..."

1)Kill them all
2)*Let's join forces in defeating the screeper

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Wendy: "What will you do?"

1)Leave it up to Wendy to decide
2)*Let's go together
3)Refuse
4)Remain silent

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Wendy: "I'm Wendy, and the fairy here is Yurry, and he is..."

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Wendy: "...well...an insect...got stuck...on my sleeve..."

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Wendy: "It's not fair that I'm the only one whose weakness is known. Now,
you'd better say yours as well!"

1)I'll never say it
2)*Tell her
3)Ignore her

Picking the 2nd choice will open another set of options:

1)Sweets
2)Women
3)Work

I picked the 1st but I think the other 2 are also fine...

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Yurry: "The normal person is unable to sense it, making such a thing
unbelievable to them."

1)I can't act according to something that I cannot agree with
2)*What does that mean?
3)I don't get why but I'll just do accordingly

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Rukias: "...what happened to those huge stuff that were floating in the sky?"

1)They don't exist right from the beginning
2)They were destroyed
3)*Why did you ask that?
4)Remain silent

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Rukias: "If you are going to another town, I'd like to tag alone..."

1)*Agree
2)Refuse
3)Leave the decision to Wendy

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Yarjen area
 ===========

Terrorist: "You guys are from the Monopolis huh."

2)Deny
3)Remain silent

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Yurry: "The war can't end because your company is selling weapons..."

1)Agree
2)Don't agree
3)Say nothing

Though the 2nd choice is rather straightforward, but it's actually true in the
sense that the war won't end abruptedly(though there is a high possibility
that the war will end as according to what Wendy will say a lil bit later on
in the game) even if monopolis stopped selling weapons. Apparantly, this is a
rather difficult situation because both of the choices(1 and 2) have their
valid points.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Norstool area
 =============

Terrorist: "It will be bad for us if the Monopolis continue to expand
further."

1)That is the freedom of economic tradings
2)It's for the sake of the world
3)*It's the same no matter which organisation wins

1)*Terrorists
2)People from rival companies
3)Don't answer

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Rukias: "Did they think that their revolution was a success when common
civilians are being hurt?"

1)It's because they think that way that's why they are terrorists
2)Agree with Rukias
3)*The common civilians suffered no losses

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Rukias: "That means..."

1)The number of terrorists dropped
2)*Someone is gathering the terrorists together
3)Remain silent

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chriass: "There's something I'd like to ask, do you guys know of a man named
Zeakvalt?"

1)I only know the name
2)*Seems like he fought the Queen
3)Know nothing
4)Remain silent

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Wendy: "That Dragon Orb, could it be what the company is looking for?"

1)*Agree
2)Don't think so
3)I don't know

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Aboard the ship
 ===============

-Party splits-

(Talk to Wendy)
Wendy: "I'm worried it may sink..."

1)Agree
2)*Don't worry
3)Remain silent

Wendy: In any case, about what we discussed just now. Do you think the Dragon
Orb is what the company is really looking for?"

1)*Indeed
2)Don't think so
3)I don't know

                                 +++++++++++++++++

(Talk to Rukias)
Rukias: "Hey, where and what were you doing before coming to this continent?"

1)*Guarding duties in the Monopolis
2)Don't remember
3)Don't tell him

Rukias: "If you are the person I'm looking for, then my mission may come to an
end..."

1)*Ask him what is the purpose of his mission
2)Remain silent

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Totour area
 ===========

Wendy: "...why did they come here to attack us?"

1)The Resistance has turned into terrorists
2)They intend to snatch the seedlings and use them as monetary resources
3)*Because the seedlings are dangerous items
4)I don't know

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-Party splits-

(Head to Rukias' room)
Rukias: "...who is it?"

1)*Tell him who you are
2)Ignore and open the door

Rukias: "What is it. If it's nothing important, leave now."

1)Came to see if Rukias is fine
2)*Ask him who is that woman
3)Leave the room

Rukias: "By the way, you are really strong. How did you manage to do that?"

1)I have the attributes
2)*Put in daily effort
3)It's a secret

                                 +++++++++++++++++

(Need to talk to Wendy before choosing to rest)
Wendy: "Just then..."

1)*There was an insect again?
2)Did you cut your finger?

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Past Noschval tunnel
 ====================

Yurry: "Miss Wendy had a very sad expression on her face awhile ago, have I
seen wrongly?"

1)She did look sad
2)You've seen wrongly
3)*Don't probe into it

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Wendy: "...what the Resistance said was true...?"

1)A coincidence
2)*Perhaps
3)They are wrong
4)Say nothing

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Potrad village(desolated)
 =========================

Wendy: "Who could have done that?"

1)Terrorist
2)That Resistance woman
3)*Shuweizer
4)Don't know

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Rukias: "...the rapid rise of the Monopolis may well be due to his secret
activities."

1)I can't believe it
2)*That's a possibility
3)Remain silent

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Potrad village(past)
 ====================

Shuweizer: "Once these are dead, the negotiations will go smoothly."

1)It is not fine to kill people
2)*Lives are more important than business tradings
3)Use force to stop him
4)Remain silent

I think the 1st and 2nd choices are the preferable ones.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Wendy: "...now we are not part of the company anymore..."

1)Agree
2)*I have no desire for that sort of company
3)Do you have an affection for a company that kills people?

Choosing either the 1st or the 2nd is better IMO because I take into
consideration why Wendy feels bad about not being able to remain in the
Monopolis as she still has something she wants to do there.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Potrad village(original)
 ========================


Wendy: "If that's the case, then wouldn't he be able to go there before our
appearance and change the history again...?"

1)*Have no worries about that
2)Think the same thing as Wendy

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Rukias: "Let's hurry...or else they will get their hands on the orb."

1)*Agree
2)Don't think so
3)Remain silent

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 GL Transgate Center
 ===================

Rukias: "The Potrad said something."

1)Change the light to open the gate
1)*Attach the light to go past the gate
2)Bend the light to shut the gate

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Rukias: "However, once we catch up to them, what are you going to do?"

1)Prevent them from using it for evil intentions
2)Get it back for the sake of the Peace Maintenance Army
3)Destroy it
4)Get back the Dragon Orb
5)Haven't thought of it

This is pretty much free choice. If you want to please Rukias, 4th choice
is probably the best. If you want to please Zeonsilt(another playable
character you will get later on), the 2nd one works best. Try not to take the
3rd though because that's rather stupid. I believe the 1st choice is a safe
pick if you ain't sure.

==============================================================================
                                Esgrenz Part 3
==============================================================================

 Makinus
 =======

Iristelessa: "Do you have any questions?"

1)The Infinitor's real identity
2)Infinitor's objective
3)What will happen if we leave it as it is?
4)None

You have the choice to ask all questions before picking the 4th one.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Iristelessa: "Can't anything be done?"

1)Climb up the wall of the building
2)*Look for a way to get the Card Key
3)Give up

The 1st choice is a great idea only that this game ain't spiderman or shinobi
related =)

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Iristelessa: "...tell me again what I should do."

1)*Tell her to hang in there
2)Do you want to get caught!?
3)Follow Rukias
4)Follow Wendy

I think any of the choices above is fine, since it's part of your battle
commands. However, the 2nd one doesn't seem to be very good.

2nd choice opens a set of options:

1)Defeat the president
2)*Destroy the spirit being

Rukias: "So, is the Infinitor only of spirit form?"

1)*It's impossible for it to have only a spirit form
2)Maybe
3)Don't know

let your identity be known?"

1)Agree with Rukias
2)*Don't agree

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Maxwell: "I brought her out of the village before it was attacked and escaped
from the Monopolis."

1)Why didn't you tell the villagers?
2)*Express understanding regarding his actions

You can pick the 1st as well which sounds more like a doubt instead of blaming
him for not informing the villagers. If you didn't, Rukias will ask him that
question anyway.

from the start?"

 Shizaaz area
 ============

(Talk to Neilis)
Neilis: "Do you know where is President Brandole?"

2)No

Either is fine but the 1st may be somewhat better because at least you are
telling her something you knew.

Neilis: "If you are a real human, then tell me! Why didn't he praise me?"

1)*Because you failed at something
2)Because the president don't bother about such a thing
3)I don't know

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Hofman: "Are you guys from the Monopolis as well?"

1)Yes
2)No

Free choice IMO, because neither is completely true.

accusations."

1)Help him out

3)Remain silent

Hofman: "That's why, I'd like to check and affirm his safety..."

helped..."

1)Watch over his progress and growth silently
2)*The real reason is what happened after the attack on the village

                                 +++++++++++++++++

You can pick the 1st choice, and talk to her again for the options again. But
once you choose the 3rd choice, you don't have a second chance.

attention."

2)*Yarstill barracks look suspicious
3)Gather information in Leystan
4)To play safe, let's head to Makinus

Pick the 2nd or 3rd choice. 2nd is the exact location but the 3rd is what the
game requires you do before you head to the barracks.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Leystan area
 ============

Yurry: "This happened because Maxwell is missing..."

1)Let's make haste to save him

Try the 1st or 2nd because Yurry disagrees with the 3rd. For me, I prefer the

Wendy: We shall we do then?

1)Let's attack together
2)*Have 2 persons stay here to lure the enemies

destroy the 3 remaining towers within 3 hours."

1)Can't we take over the control of the towers?
2)Using the Giant?
3)Agree

None of the choices are wrong imo so it shouldn't make too much of a
difference no matter which you pick.

2)Remain silent

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Yurry: "Did you have a nightmare?"

is better.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Leystan area
 ============

-Party splits-

(Try to exit Leystan and pick 'There's something about that red wolf member
that troubles me' and talk to the red wolf member 2 screens south of Leystan)

Shuweizer: "...used the equipment that was brought to Lenocks."

1)Why didn't you let us know you are alive?

1)I may throw it away later on

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Wendy: "Was it okay without me?"

1)Same as always

offend her.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Wendy: "...Thank you...I'm fine..."

1)I'm glad you felt better
2)*You are always welcomed
3)Let's get going

I believe the 1st is okay too but I always picked the 2nd choice.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 L'Hingis
 ========

Wendy: "..."

1)What are you thinking?
2)Let's make the revolution a success
3)Say nothing

Pick either the 1st or 2nd one.

1)It's too late to worry about it now
2)*Maxwell is correct
3)Do you wish to stop the revolution?

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Maxwell: "I will only be a handicap to you guys."

1)*Leave it to us
2)Tell him about Wendy's concern

Wendy will not be happy if you choose the 2nd choice. She just doesn't like
showing her weaknesses...imo.

2)*Be modest
3)Remain silent

Rukias: "If we can try to save Lera as many times as we want, I wouldn't be
so worried and scared."

1)Do you intend to throw away that chance?
2)Right from the start, that chance doesn't exist
3)*One chance is enough

                                 +++++++++++++++++

(Choose to rest)
Yurry: "...why am I a fairy? It would be great if I'm a human being like
everyone else..."

1)If you are a human, we can't travel through time
2)It's a pointless thought
3)*What would you like to do if you are a human?

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Royferon
 ========

(Ask to meet Merne)

Wendy: "...I wonder if she'll be able to see my growth?

1)*Just show her the way you are now
2)I don't know

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[P/S: At this point in time, you should have red ratings for Wendy, Rukias,
Anita and Irist. Don't worry if they are still at green though. Hofman is the
toughest nut to crack in the entire game for me but he should be at green
now since his side quest should have been completed by now.]

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Makinus
 =======

Wendy: "Why are there screepers? There are pollumina trees growing there..."

1)They developed the immunity
2)*It doesn't have any effect right from the beginning
3)Reason is unknown

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Iristelessa: "The towers are devices that absorb energy as well. His motives
are the same."

1)What does he intend to do with the gathered energy?

You can pick the 1st or 3rd choice.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1)*I'm depending on you
2)Don't expect anything out of you

                                 +++++++++++++++++

Yurry: "...time travel!?"

1)2000 years is impossible no matter how old he may be
2)*It's possible with use of the Pollumina fruits

The 1st choice is not contradicting to the plot since the Infinitor is using
Brandole's body, therefore the amount of years he can travel back is
restricted by Brandole's age, not his(especially since he's not human).

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Anita: "2000 years are just too much..."

1)*Tell her about myself
2)Remain silent

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

---Names summary---                                                       [N1]

Many Kanji word forms can be difficult to translate into English without
sounding out of place or even weird. This is something we see even in some
professional translations. However, for people who don't know how to pronounce
the words, using romaji all over the place is very confusing. Using Japanese
characters is meaningless because people who don't understand is not gonna go
and match each and every word, and people who understand don't need them here.
Therefore, I will explain in details here some of the translated names in this
FAQ to avoid pointless arguments as well as any doubts that may occur while
playing the game and reading this FAQ.

If you would like provide me with more appropriate words to use, I welcome
those emails.

1)Goat Land:

Goat Land is the continent G5 took place on and the originally sealed off
continent in VI. It was said that Esgrenz has gotten peace through
sacrificing that of Goat Land's, thus making the continent a scapegoat kinda
idea, and so the name Goat Land. I thought I had put an explanation in case
anyone wonders what the whole stuff is about.

2)Dai-chi no Pen-dan-to:

'Daichi' itself can refer to 'Earth', 'Land' and so on. But since this game
is not Star Ocean, I think using 'Earth' is inappropriate, and so I decided
to go with 'Land' == 'Land's pendant'.

3)Mi-ko:

'Miko' has many representations to a person/maiden who is pure and serving a
god, sacred child kinda meaning, or at least in those I have seen. Another
meaning would be a more modern form, which is a medium or someone who uses
sorcery and so on. However, for Irist in this game, none of those references
really match. Therefore I used 'spirit maiden' instead.

4)Ryuu-ketsu-to:

'Ryuu' is dragon, the same for 'ryuu gyoku'(which I translate as Dragon Orb)
and 'ryuu-myaku'(which can be translated as Dragon Vein). 'Ketsu' means a
hole. 'To' is tower. In this case, it becomes Dragon hole tower. I don't mind
if anyone insist on that or something similar, but since the towers are used
to gather energy from the Dragon Vein to raise the soaring ship, I think
'Energy Tower' sounds better. I don't want to be labelled as a big failure
like the one who translated Suikoden's Star Dragon Sword just because I can't
pinpoint an exact meaning but still want to stick to translating word for word
no matter what, especially since I'm not paid to do this FAQ.

5)Hei-wa i-ji gu-n

Peace Maintainence Army is a word for word translation. My serious lack of
vocabulary shows a lot here.

6)Ama-kakeru-fune

'Ama'='sky', 'kakeru' = flying, 'fune' = 'ship', so it becomes 'Soaring Ship'.

7)Pollumina

It's actually written as po-ryu-mi-ne which as mentioned in a part of this
FAQ, is the short form for pollution(po-ryu) elimination(mi-ne). Even though
it's mi-ne(in terms of pronounciation), I used mi-na because that's really
taken directly from the word 'eli(mina)tion'.

8)Sei-bo no hi-yaku

For me, seibo is really difficult to translate to a decent english word so
since this seibo is named Claudia, I decided to go with Claudia's medicine.

--Character quests--                                                      [C1]

This section lists the character quests. You might want to pair usage of this
with the questions and response section for a more detailed reference.


++Wendy++
At Shizaaz(after you meet Hofman the 2nd time), try to walk to where Wendy is
after party separates, after that, talk to the boy and choose that you will
explain things to Wendy. Talk to Wendy again and choose to tell her what the
boy mentioned. In the first mission at the entrance of the Giant, bring Wendy
over to talk to Beckel(the captain). After the mission, rest inside the Giant
and choose to ask Wendy about the matter.

After you have finished the mission at the black market against Wellber, talk
to the man located near the inn's entrance(in Royferon), he will mention
Merne. Go to the jewel shop and talk to the owner to ask to meet his wife.
Then stay at the inn. After the revolution at Hingistan, talk to Wendy when
party separates at L'Hingis(she's at the castle front) and choose to tell her
about Merne. Next, bring her back to the jewel shop at Royferon and talk to
the owner again. Suggest to Wendy to cook up a meal for Merne. That will
trigger the ingredients searching quest. Get [Rare item: Spices Set], [Rare
item: Fish], [Rare item: Hingistan Fruits] and [Rare item: Fresh Potrad
Vegetables] from the respective places: item shops at Royferon, Shizaaz,
L'Hingis and the Potrad who gave you the gate opener/gate ring at Potrad
village. Once finished, head back to Royferon and stay at the inn. That will
trigger the last event of Wendy's quest.

*Thanks to yung tian huei for telling me he still managed to get Wendy's
ending despite not doing the ingredients searching quest, which means it is
optional. He said the triggering point for the quest is during a conversation
with Wendy at the Resistance hideout: to choose whether Wendy intends to let
Maxwell try her cooking. I haven't confirmed this, but to respond to his
request of putting up a note, so here it is.


++Rukias++
For Rukias, things will start off automatically when the party stay at the inn
during the course of the game. 3 times you will hear Rukias having the same
nightmare. At Shizaaz(after you meet Hofman the 2nd time), talk to Rukias to
ask him why he wants to get stronger, then choose the option of 'the real
reason is what happened after the attack on the village' to learn of what
happened to him and Lera when he was younger. At the screen north and then
east of Leystan, go to the lower right and investigate the small time
distortion warp. After that, go talk to the woman(Lera's mum) at Leystan
(somewhere in front of the inn). 

Continue to talk to Rukias whenever party separates and when asked by Yurry,
choose that you wish to have a try at going back time to save Lera. Talk to
Rukias again about the decision and be firm about it in your replies. Rukias
will ask for some time to think about it until the final party dismissal
period before going to the soaring ship. Talk to him again and agree to
accompany him. Try to leave Makinus and you'll get transferred to the time
distortion warp automatically. Rukias will use Lera's bloodstained
handkerchief to strengthen the warp and you'll get drawn into a short mission.


Location             : Road near Leystan
Usable Characters    : Merklich, Rukias
Recommended Level    : Nil
Enemies              - 4 monsters
NPCs                 : Lera
Clear conditions     - Defeat all monsters
Game Over conditions - Party eliminated

The main thing is to hold the monsters off until Lera make her escape. If you
want a mission complete, kill all monsters before the the time limit is up.
Critical Hit works well for that.


++Irist++

Just talk to her and choose the appropriate replies. Once you get to know
about how her Brave Guard died, go to Lenocks and enter the medical room and
talk to the doctor. Choose to ask him about the matter. When the party
separates before Irist uses the Dragon Orb to raise the soaring ship up, talk
to her and choose to tell her that the truth.


++Hofman++

After you meet Hofman the 2nd time at Shizaaz, talk to him and choose Makinus
as the place you think of. The next time he is in your party, bring him to
talk to the man(not the soldier) standing at the docks in front of Monopolis
building. Next, bring him to Leoray village(hire the carry). Once inside the
village, keep going left to reach the beach. Talk to man there. Then go back
to previous screen and enter the big door to the medical room.

Talk to the guy at the counter and choose to visit the man(Bowman) who lost
his memory. After conversation, go back to Leystan and knock on the left most
door and obtain [Rare item: Captain's Pendant]. Go back to Leoray and ask for
a visit to Bowman again. Talk to Bowman and after scene, go back to Leystan
again and inform the boy on his father having regained his memory.


++Anita++

For Anita, there is no side quest. Just be appropriate in your replies to her.
If you want to play safe, you should go to Lenocks Research Center and down to
the cell she was in. Pick up the [Rare item: Unusable Pen]. Bring the
handkerchief+bookmark+pen to Yarjen without her in your party and use them for
Nora to reflect the memories contained within. Also try talking to the woman
in Dastis. If you want to be thorough, you can try and trigger the short
Shuweizer event. Not a must, but they do help if you are lost.


++Zeonsilt++

If you gave Fanil the Pollumina seedling earlier on in the game, and went back
after some time and agree to introduce her to the researchers at Lenocks
center after getting Shayer's permission and Chriass's approval on her side,
she will join as NPC and you're supposed to bring her to the Lenocks center
(if you glance through the earlier missions I've listed down, you will see one
with her included). After a certain amount of time, go back WITHOUT Zeon in
your party.

She will give you her letter to Randy, go to Juwaina and talk to Randy. You
are supposed to go through the mine to the west of Juwaina with Randy as NPC.
Go through to the bottom level and you enter a short mission:

Location             : Mine west of Juwaina
Usable Characters    : Merklich, Wendy, Rukias, Irist, Hofman, Anita
                       (Choose 4)
Recommended Level    : Any
Enemies              - Monsters
NPCs                 : Randy
Clear conditions     - Leave screen after Randy has gotten Posaya and escaped
Game Over conditions - Death of NPC(Randy)
                     - Poison gauge reached maximum
                     - All party members eliminated

You are supposed to direct Randy to go to those shiny items and examine them
to see which is the real thing. For your levels, it is possible to defeat all
enemies, but it's up to you.

Leave mine, go back to Lenocks and give the posaya to Fanil. After some time,
put Zeon in your party and talk to her again and choose to have him go
through the procedure.

If you did this little side quest, you will save Zeon from his screeper cells
danger and will be able to use him for your last 2 battles, though Corin won't
follow him around anymore. Also note that he WILL LOSE his ability to weaken
screepers once it is done. During the above mentioned conversation, you can
choose to have him drink the remedy at a later time if you still need him for
some screeper battles.

If you brought Fanil to the center but did not complete the quest, after the
Energy Tower is destroyed, the center will be destroyed as well which means
Fanil died. Of course, if you did complete it, Lenocks center will still be in
good shape after the energy tower event.

If you can't get the events to trigger, try resting at inns several times
(which worked for me along with some exploring around different towns). I have
noted for my plays that the final event(bringing Zeon to talk to Fanil) won't
happen until Mission 44 is finished so you might want to take note of that.


++Yurry++

Go talk to the old man in Shizaaz somewhere later in the game(around the time
when Royferon becomes available*). He's in the house left of the weapon shop.
Head over to Dastis library and investigate the bookshelf besides the elevator
on the 1st floor until you locate the Growlanser legend book. Go back to the
old man and talk to him again. He will give Yurry a book regarding the fairy+
Growlanser ending. This will trigger an event with Yurry after the Hingistan
revolution. On the night before Irist uses the orb to raise up the soaring
ship. You'll get another event with Yurry having finished reading the book.
Choose 'Concerned about Yurry' and 'What if the other party has fallen in love
as well'. After Infinitor's final battle, Yurry will comment on how Merklich
is alone, choose 'Yurry is here'.

*Thanks to yung tian huei for emails which informed me it is possible to begin
this quest earlier, which he noted as "after the defensive battle of Shizaaz"
(according to this faq, it's after mission 25). After another trip through the
game, I've affirmed this to be correct.


++Neilis++
When she appeared as NPC near Potrad and Shizaaz village, choose to head over
and talk to her. Be nice to her until the 2nd time she pops up at Potrad
village entrance, choose to talk to her again and she should give Merk her
knife. You can view her memories by talking to Nora at Yarjen. When asked by
Yurry before the last 2 battles, choose 'someone who is not here'. After you
defeat the Infinitor and on your way to the clone pod room, look at the radar.
There is a green dot. Run over and talk to Neilis, choose to bring her along
(2nd choice).


==============================================================================
==============================================================================

--Coliseum--                                                             [C2]

The Coliseum is located at the Peace Maintainence Army base. Talk to the guy
at the stand/booth to the left of the main gate(not entrance). To participate
and win at the Coliseum matches, you don't require just abilities, you need
lotsa money. Winning matches will give a boost in relationship levels, at
least that's what really happened to me, which I believe is triggered by the
Mission Complete screens, thus adding on points to the affection levels.

P/S: Take note that prizes listed are as in my play, the prize system of this
coliseum works in such a way that if you have a full inventory for a certain
item(e.g: you already own 9 dandy books in your inventory), they will give
you money instead(when the original prize should be dandy books). Therefore do
not take my list as an absolute since I did not keep track of my inventory.


-->Damage Matches

--->Physical dmg
As with previous Growlanser games, you hit the esgrenz golem and the highest
physical dmg you dealt to it is recorded.

             Ranking chart
-----------------------------------------
 Character           | Score
-----------------------------------------
 Shuweizer           | 689
-----------------------------------------
 Gyaricke            | 623
-----------------------------------------
 Chriass             | 578
-----------------------------------------
 Sheris              | 514
-----------------------------------------
 Loofass             | 455
-----------------------------------------
 Mervina             | 401
-----------------------------------------
 Maxwell             | 342
-----------------------------------------
 Bactor              | 260
-----------------------------------------
 Eimy                | 221
-----------------------------------------

My way is by:
-Sol spectrum equipped
-Gems: stack
 ->penance, this increases dmg by 50%, but character HP-50% of the total
   damage dealt, e.g: normal attack 150HP, with penance, attack is
   150+[150/2]=225, [225/2]=113, so 113 will be taken off from character's HP
 ->annihilation, this increases critical chances by 20%
 ->attack, this increases attack power
 ->strength, this increases the ATK stat
 ->willpower, this increases max MP
-Critical skill plate level 5
-Attack magic level 9 before match
-Weaken magic level 5 on golem once match starts
-Inferno level 9

You can also use berserk(which works like penance only that you can't control
the character until a certain amount of time has passed) if you want, but I
wouldn't recommend that as that will require you to have the HP absorb and HP
regeneration skill, otherwise you'll die very easily, and the system work in
such a way that if you die, there will be no record made.

--->MGC dmg
Works the same as physical, only you use magic, and the counter begins
immediately when the match starts.

My way is by:
-Gems: stack
 ->intelligence, this increases the INT stat
 ->magic pillar, this increases effect of healing and attack magic
-Skills:
 ->Lv 9 Spirit boost
 ->Lv 9 Strengthen magic
 ->Lv 9 Shorten chant time
-When match starts, use strengthen magic skill and pick blast Lv 5

--->Overall dmg total
This will let you attack the golem as many times as you can within the time
limit, and they will add up the total amount of dmg you've dealt to the golem.

 Bactor              | 1864
-----------------------------------------

My way is:
-equipping the same equipment as what I wrote in physical dmg above
-MP and HP absorb and regenerating skills
-Melee skills which stops time while it is being executed such as critical
 strike, all-round-attack etc
-Piercing aura skill, this will take off a certain amount of HP periodically
 from an enemy within a fixed distance
-Attack Lv 9 and Cycle-up Lv 7 before match
-Match starts, use Inferno Lv 9, then use critical strike Lv 7 until the MP
bar fills up, then use Inferno again, then use all-round-attack Lv 6 until
MP bar fills up again, then use Inferno again and repeat until time is up.
In between if HP is low, heal with items.

Though you can use anything to attack the golem, I wouldn't recommend magic
since that is obviously a waste of time if you want to pit against those at
the top of the ranking chart.


-->Elimination Class

Like the name says, you fight 5 groups of monsters to pass through one class.
Only Merklich can be used. This section is probably one of the better ways to
earn some quick money.

1)Copper Class
This is easy and one hit should kill each monster.
1st--->bombtree, werecat
2nd--->skeleton, lizardman
3rd--->mutant gel, zombie
4th--->devil's servant, ghoul
5th--->direstripe, will-o-wisp, devil plant
Prize: 800+1800 = 2600mil

2)Silver Class
Same as copper, very easy.
1st--->poisoner, solidated avatar
2nd--->floater, puppet golem
3rd--->specter, myconid
4th--->werepanther, jade statue
5th--->devil plant, evil mage, necromancer
Prize: 3 Dandy books

3)Gold Class
1st--->tiny dragon, lizardmanlord
2nd--->fatal vermin, phase walker
3rd--->dusk drake, terror poisoner
4th--->dread magus, bronze golem
5th--->azure statue, gargolye, lesser demon
Prize: 500+500+500+5000 = 6500mil

4)Platina Class
This will be a lil harder, but nothing that you can't manage. Enemies will
die with at most 2 hits.
1st--->spirit, giant
2nd--->troll, death fungus
3rd--->armor balloon, greater demon
4th--->titan, puncher
5th--->lich, skeleton knight, arch demon
Prize: 5000+5000+5000 = 15000mil


-->Tug Battle

The tug battle is probably the most interesting section. You choose one
character to form a 2 person team with Merklich and fight matches with other
teams. Melee skills are your buddies here, better yet if you've got Inferno.

1)Bactor Team, Prize: Ramadas manual
--->Bactor Team consists of Bactor and another Grangeil soldier. They are
really the ones you use for Loofass optional scenario in V. If you can't win
this battle, something's really wrong.

2)Esgrenz Team, Prize: 2 Clear incense
--->Esgrenz Team consists of Zafreed and Wellber. You should kill off Zafreed
first since we know he has got good magic. Wellber is a wimp.

3)Sheriltia Team
Prize: turquoise, sapphire, emerald, topaz, ruby, amethyst(one each)
--->Sheriltia Team tells you Sheris is one of the them. They are the ones you
use for Sheris optional scenario in V. Aim for Safia first, then Sheris.

4)I-ji-gun Team, Prize: 2 Vit's medicine
--->I-ji-gun is maintainence army, so it tells you the team is from the peace
maintainence army, therefore we have Chriass and Mervina. Aim for Mervina
first since Chriass will probably cut off his hair before he use magic in
this match.

5)Slayer Team, Prize: 2 Elixirs
--->The name is so obvious, so it's the very popular Gyaricke and Loofass
here. Loofass is weaker so finish him first. However, Gyaricke isn't a threat
either.

6)Leader Team, Prize: 1 limit removal
--->Who else remains apart from Shuweizer and Maxwell. Shuweizer is more
dangerous and getting rid of him straight away is better. Either way, this
match is still pretty easy.

7)Hunter Team, Prize: 1 eclipse mirror
--->The group of hunters from V, Zeakvalt and Alessa. Kill Alessa first no
matter what. As for Zeakvalt, he has got HP regeneration plus HP absorbing
skill and pretty high defense and attack stats. If the level from his
optional scenario in V remains, he's at 67. So it'll take much more time to
finish this as compared to the early matches.

8)President Team
Prize: chaos original(1st time), 1 limit removal+1 eclipse mirror(subsequent)
--->Brandole and Neilis. This is much easier than the earlier one in my
opinion. Kill Neilis first then Brandole.

9)Screeper Team
Prize: 1 mu-sou gem(ivaldi), 1 koto-dama gem(ord-leril), 1 Splendor gem(M2)
For me, this becomes available after I defeated the Queen screeper class under
the slayer title match. For explanation on the triggering elements for this
match, refer to the slayer title queen class just slightly below for my notes.

--->DO NOT ATTEMPT THIS MATCH unless both of your characters(merk+one more
which you get to pick from your party) are above level 75(you will still have
a hard time unless you are at LV 80++ though). This is the hardest fight in
the entire game simply because you can no longer get blessing bells easily as
in previous Growlanser games.

You will facing two(2) Queen screepers. Choose a melee character(I recommend
Zeon or Hofman, I used Zeon due to personal preference though) with high HP
and DEF. As always, make sure you equip the strongest weapon+armor and the
appropriate gems(I won't repeat this again) and have both merk and the other
character to have the skills I listed under the Queen screeper slayer match.
And as usual, attack+protect+cycle up and also bring also a full inventory of
healing items, especially 9 medicine to cure faint and 9 panaceas and 9
nectars just to be safe.

Aim for the queen on the right first(the one with the disgusting big head or
whatever that is that when I first saw it I thought it is a king ^.^), spread
out your characters but not too far away. If both queens have one of your
characters as a target, it is very easy for him/her to faint, and when that
happens, you must have the remaining character cure it asap(don't use fine
magic unless you have the shorten chant time skill). If the queens have
different targets(1 to 1), then you probably should bring along some elixirs
as well. Always re-cast Lv 9 Attack and Lv 9 Protect status magic on your
characters, especially Attack, since the queens will also cast protect on
themselves, lowering the dmg dealt to them normally. Since you can only get
this match after defeating the queen at the slayer match, the queens in this
match have HP bars so you can keep track of your battle progress and not lose
hope. =)


-->Expert Vision Match

For me, this section appears after I beat the President Team for the tug
matches. Basically, you choose a character to form a team with Merklich and
fight 3 other teams in a battle == 4 teams fighting against each other at the
same time. The enemy teams are the same as the tug ones. From the amount of
enemies Merklich's team defeated(max=3 teams x 2 members =6), you get to
choose the same amount of skill/techniques/arcane scrolls and manuals from 3
long lists. I find most of them pretty useless though. For most part, using
them will allow your character to gain a certain ability plate that they
haven't already gotten from the normal weapon/armor equipment.


-->Slayer Title Match

This lets Merklich fight to become a certain level of Slayer. Equipping the
Penetrating Gem doesn't work. Having Yurry with higher levels of abilities is
good here because that increases the chances of her blocking away the attacks
for Merklich, which will prove useful when you are fighting Knight class and
above.

1)Pawn Class, prize: dandy book, Pawn Slayer title

2)Rook Class, prize: slepinir's blood, Rook Slayer title

3)Knight Class, prize: lucky symbol, Knight Slayer title

4)Bishop Class, prize: alsolb's bell, Bishop Slayer title
->For the Bishop Class, I would suggest you bring along an inventory of
healing items you can buy from shops. You don't need too much, but just have
enough.

5)Yakuto Class, prize: swimwear for Yurry, Yakuto Slayer title
->This is the silver white hunter screeper from V. Like the bishop, this type
regenerates 12HP every few hits so that can be quite troublesome. If you have
the piercing aura, it won't work here(at least for me, probably because the
size and body structure of this screeper makes it so that the distance is too
far for the aura to work). Bring a full inventory of healing items and
remember your Attack+cycle up+protect magic and useful gems.

6)Queen class, prize: Queen Slayer title, 1 mu-sou gem(gives ivaldi skill),
                      1 koto-dama gem(gives the ord-reril skill)
I don't know how to trigger this, but I'll make a list of the situations for
your reference:

a)I did not get this in my 1st playthrough
b)In my 1st playthrough, I did not complete/win ALL sections of the coliseum,
such as defeating all 6 enemy team members in the vision match nor attempted
to defeat all gold gels and so on.
c)I got this in a new game+, even WITHOUT completing all sections of the
coliseum

So based on the above points, it means that this will definitely be available
in a new game+, and the only question is whether we can get this in a 1st play
through the game by completing ALL sections of coliseum. This I wouldn't know
since I don't have my old save data anymore(sorry). So in the end, no matter
what the case is, just use this as a mark: if you have completed all sections
of the coliseum and still did not get this, then that means it is not
available, and you can give up trying to access it =)

->Have Merk to be at least Lv 70 before you challenge this. The queen screeper
will not regenerate HP, and imo is probably easier than the yakuto depending
on the skills you gave to Merk. Have HP and MP regeneration and if possible HP
and MP absorb skills as well. Bring a full inventroy of healing items, and as
usual use Lv 9 Attack, Protect and Cycle Up before entering the match. Do not
use Inferno(I have tested this out several times and it didn't hurt the queen
at all). Having the piercing aura skill is also good. Equip gems which gives
accumulated bonuses in atk as well as def. The queen may adopt a brace stance
during the battle and after a short period of time, will use Sonic Eraser,
which I don't think can be avoided since it shoots in a long straight line.


-->Gold Gel Bonus Battle(no prizes, but the gels may drop items)

This bonus battle will only appear after you go to the Resistance hideout
later in the game to kill off a gold gel. You have 12 gold gels to kill.
They give lotsa money and technique points, but you have to pay 30000 to
fight one of these battles and in normal cases you won't obtain enough mil
to recover back what you paid to enter the match.

Take too long and they will exit one by one. Inferno is recommended, or at
least bring along characters who are strong with physical/melee attacks.
The gels will run in all directions as your characters approach them, so try
and use the slep's blood for whichever character with inferno so he can catch
up to them before they spread out too far and immediately use inferno. As for
the rest, use melee skills like critical strike and so on.


-->Soul Bonus Battle(no prizes, but the souls may drop items)

This bonus battle will only appear after you go to the ruins near Zeldock to
kill off a soul. You have 12 Souls to kill here. Just bring along a strong
magic user like Anita, have her chant a Level 4 or so Blizzard and use it to
kill them all in 1 shot. How convenient. You need to pay 30000 to fight one of
these battles, but the you can easier raise all your character levels here
(each battle won gives you 20000+ EXP at LV 55+. The higher your levels, the
lower the EXP will become though) so it's really worth it. Take too long and
you will get crushed with Meteors and Blasts and they will exit one by one as
well.

--Characters--                                                          [DCH1]

This section lists the characters that make an appearance/played a part in the
story of the game.


[PLAYABLE CHARACTERS+STRONGEST WEAPON AND ARMOR]

++Merklich++

Merk is more of a fighter than a magic user, since his MP is not very high,
but his magic effect is probably slightly above average and can be made even
better with skill plates that boost his magic abilities. Nevertheless, most of
the time it's better to have him stick to melee attacks. His MOV, ATW and DEX
stats are pretty balanced, excellent HP bar, ATK and decent DEF.

Weapon: After Mission 37 and your party splits, leave the town to search for
the red wolf army member and talk to him. Once you did that, he should be at
the bridge(2nd screen) in front of Monopolis building when your party
separates for the last time before heading to the soaring ship. Get the [Rare
item: Exhibition Item Key] from him and use it at the weapon display case on
the 8th floor(database room) of the Monopolis building.

Armor: Defeat the President Team for the Tug Battle at the Coliseum.


++Wendy++

Wendy can be used as a fighter or magic user or both, use her to heal or cast
magic when required and fight up-front when healing is not necessary, because
her HP and DEF are rather high, you don't have to worry too much about her in
battles. 

Weapon: Once the soaring ship becomes accessible, go to the Resistance hideout
and head down to Maxwell's room. Examine his bed and choose to use the [Rare
item: Maxwell Key] you got after the revolution on the box. You'll probably
have to fight the Gold Gel here(gives a good amount of Mil and opens the Gold
Gel Bonus Battle over at the Coliseum) as well as the Lv 56 Gigaton Punchers.
Also, you don't have to bring Wendy along to get this.

Armor: After completing her side quest, talk to Wendy when the party is
dismissed for the last time before heading to the soaring ship.


++Rukias++

Try to keep Rukias away from the frontline(there is a reason why he fights
with indirect physical attacks). He has got a good max MP bar very useful for
using Inferno and though he should be used for magic most of the time, he can
prove helpful with his indirect physical attacks as well. He's also probably
the character with the highest MOV and DEX(unless the Zeon you loaded from
your G5 data has very high stats).

Weapon: After saving Lera, bring Rukias and talk to her mum at Leystan.

Armor: After the soaring ship becomes accessible, go to the Peace Maintainence
Army base main gate and talk to Chriass. He asks for help in getting the
stolen items back from a group of bandits who rummaged the army's storage
house. Hire Carry at inn over to Zeldock. At that screen, go upper left via
the route which leads to Mount Norstool. Follow the only path until you come
to the hideout located at the bottom left of the screen(if you've played G5
before, it's the place where Seldiss & Eizack found the Admonisher).

Go in and on the 2nd screen, you will enter into a mission.

Location             : Mount Norstool
Usable Characters    : Merk, Wendy, Rukias, Irist, Hofman, Anita, Zeon
                       (Choose 4)
Recommended Level    : Nil
Enemies              - Bandits around LV 56
Clear conditions     - Defeat all enemies
Game Over conditions - Party eliminated

Just remember to heal when needed and it should be finished. Get the stolen
items back after battle. Bring them back to Chriass.


++Irist++

Irist, as with Anita, is probably the weakest characters. Average ATK, DEF,
HP, good MP and magic. She can't hit much for physical attacks, but at least
better than Anita, comforting thing though is her attack range is one of the
longest along with Rukias. For most situations, you'll have to keep her away
from the enemies.

Weapon: Win the match against Peke(bedding dog) and bring the [Rare item:
World Tree Branch] to the village of the dragon orb protectors(east and north
of felmentia). On the eastern row of houses, knock on the 3rd one starting
from the right. Switch screens and knock on the door again. You'll need to
bring Irist along.

Armor: Once you've gotten the origin bow(strongest weapon), bring Irist to
Elfan forest(north of Leoray) and talk to the fairy elder(the green one).


++Hofman++

Hofman is loaded with HP and DEF, use him as a decoy whenever you can and
want to. He's not very good at magic unless you give him each and every skill
that can boost magic usage, otherwise it's better to have him use physical
attacks.

Weapon: After you have completed Hofman's side quest. After the party
separates for the last time before heading to the soaring ship, go to the
dormitory and talk to the person at the counter, choose to rest and she will
ask Merklich to give the leviathan to Hofman, which is a gift from Daytlich.
Go back out and talk to Hofman.

Armor: Rank top at both the Dmg and Mgc Dmg matches as well as the overall 
total dmg thereafter at the Coliseum.


++Anita++

Anita has the lowest HP, but probably the highest MP. Her indirect attacks
from the magic rods/staves are not that useful in important battles, magic
is still the answer. She has low DEF as well, no matter what, have no enemies
near her. Her other stats are pretty much average.

Weapon: Ya know the woman in Dastis. Have Anita in your party and talk to her.
After that, remove Anita from your party and go back to talk to her again.
After that, put Anita back in your party again and talk to her to get [Rare
item: Special Stone (mined)]. Head over to Lenocks Research Center and once
inside the main building, go up the stairs and knock on the 3rd door(special
materials research room) from the left, choose to give him the stone. After
some time, go back and knock on the 2nd door(weapons research+creation room).

Armor: This is connected with getting the strongest armor for Rukias. After
you defeat the bandits, you should have spotted the shiny item on the book
shelf. Examine it to get [Rare item: Encyclopedia of Magical Accessories].
Go to Zeldock and knock on the rightmost door on the 1st screen(if you've
played G5, it's the house of woman who give the costume paper models), choose
to give her the book and get [Rare item: Sacred Cape Paper Model] in exchange.
Buy [Rare item: White Rose Perfume] over the the flower shop(next screen of
town). Hire Carry to Guylanuck. Keep going north until you come to a screen
which has a big boulder on the far right. Examine the gadget in front of the
boulder and use the perfume on it.

Head it. See the white memo on the right? Examine it. Try and solve it
yourself. If you are lazy to, then go over to the dull color orbs and select
blue(sea)->green(field)->red(sunset). If you could care less, then just head
all the way down to the lower left shutter and choose to open it. The one who
do it will get petrified, so heal him/her. If you want, you can fight Soul
(which gives an insane amount of EXP and opens the Soul Bonus Battle over at
the Coliseum) as well as the Bone Titans(Lv 56) here. Then head through the
open path left to next screen. Go down the stairs until you spot a green item,
choose to take it to get [Rare item: Sacred Cloth]. Now leave the place and
head over to Yarjen(it's further up north). Enter and knock on the door on
the right side of the items/weapon shops. Agree to let her make the holy
shroud from the model using the cloth.


++Zeonsilt++

Zeon is not the hero of Growlanser V for nothing. He still retain his
abilities worthy of being called the fifth Growlanser(light savior No.5) in
this game, and imo is definitely the best overall character to use apart from
Merk of course.

Weapon+armor: They will be brought over if you use the G5 data with him having
his strongest equipment(longinus and final guard). I have done all optional
stuff in the game and searched around more but failed to locate these in the
game itself(without bringing over the data), therefore I think I can say that
it is impossible to have them without the G5 data(which I guess the creators
made it to be a bonus for using the data)



[NON-PLAYABLE CHARACTERS/ENEMIES]


<FROM GROWLANSER V>
**Note that this small sub-section is written to provide some explanations for
those who have not played V before.**

-->>Corin
Corin is the main fairy character in Growlanser V who acknowledged(not
verbally) Zeonsilt(main character of V) as her master+partner.

-->>Yurry
Yurry made an appearance in Growlanser V with a rather arrogant attitude
towards Corin. Not much was really shown of her besides that she is training
very hard in preparation for serving her future master and even though she has
not yet found him after so much time, she continued to work hard and earn
herself the title of Queen of Pixies. When the seal on the continent was
broken after the Queen screeper was set free and defeated, she met Merklich
who came from the outer continent and realized that the reason why she could
not locate her master before.

-->>Queen screeper
The Queen screeper(usually called 'Queen') is the main villian in G5. The
reason for its existence was not known but it is the "leader" of the water
creatures called screepers. The people on Goat Land continent was always
living in fear(avoid staying near water areas) of these creatures. It was
said that the people on this continent fought against the Queen and sealed
it up on Kytheris island. However, due to the seal being weaken, a part(in the
form of a human) of the Queen was able to escape and began working behind the
scene to destroy the seal.

-->>Chriass
Chriass became the new Peace Maintenance Army commander after his father(the
previous commander) died crashing the Admonisher(a powerful ancient weapon)
against the Queen screeper which caused the 1st outer layer to be destroyed
and thus allowing Zeonsilt and party to be able to defeat the Queen. He played
a huge role in Growlanser V, taking part in missions to solve the conflicts
between various countries on the continent and through his ideals and help
from comrades, finally succeeded in establishing a real and effective purpose
for the existence of the Peace Maintenance Army.

-->>Randy
Randy was another of the playable characters in V. He was originally part of
a justice group(who travelled around the land fighting in the name of justice,
and which probably you would have noticed when he commented on Merk's party
saying he can trust them because of the justice look in their eyes ^.^) with
Zeonsilt's father as the leader of the group. However, the group separated in
the end when Zeonsilt's father and 2 other members were killed by a Yakuto
screeper(you get to fight against this screeper class at the Coliseum). Many
years later, he became a knowledgable scholar and helped out the country of
Sheriltia in ruins exploration and deciphering of ancient technology books and
eventually met Zeonsilt and joined in the fight against the Queen.

-->>Fanil
Fanil was a researcher at the Peace Maintenance army on ways to revive the
barren land. Like Randy, she knows a lot about technology and was the one who
requested Corin to join her. You would have noticed the mutant screeper
protecting Zeonsilt while fighting the mission to protect him(in the past)
from Shuweizer. The mutant screeper was originally a human on the verge of
death. The previous Peace Maintenance Army Vice Commander(who died along with
the Commander in the Admonisher crash) carried out experiments and managed to
discover a way to save a dying person. That is to insert screeper cells which
requires human energy to keep the person alive while adding on to his/her
ability the Sound Wave Barrier which weakens screepers. However, should the
person not continue to "drink" the human energy extracts, he/she will either
die or turn into a screeper(as in the case of that mutant screeper). This
surgery was done to Zeonsilt as well but Fanil managed to discover a way with
the help of a Potrad to execute the Time Freezing technique on Zeon so that he
can continue to live as normal human without drinking the human vital energy.
That technique actually required Corin to stay with him because fairies give
out Mana when they get energy from plants.

-->>Gyaricke
Gyaricke is a general as well as the one of the 3 Slayers in the kingdom of
Grangeil. He hated the Peace Maintenance army with a passion. However, under
Chriass' control and change of approach to political matters, he eventually
learnt to treat them with an open mind.

-->>Other fairies
Miranda, Nora and Nina were the other fairies who played a small part in G5,
mainly in optional events.

-->>Zeakvalt
Zeakvalt was not seen in this game but he was mentioned much when Merk's group
reached Goat Land and thereafter when they decided to reverse the change in
history that Shuweizer created. Zeakvalt was a modified hunter who went
through experiments on his body for the sake of fighting against the
screepers. In the original history(G5's events), he fought much against the
Grangeil kingdom(killing one of the Slayers), Sheriltia as well as Zeon's
party in order to strengthen himself(by absorbing human energy) in preparation
for fighting against the Queen for when the seal is broken. He was defeated by
Zeon's party but he never taught them the way to correctly defeat the Queen,
thus the result as what we see in this game: duplicated Queens.

-->>Loofass, Mervina, Sheris
You only get to see these 3 once near the end of the game outside Felmentia
and in the Coliseum. They are all playable characters in V. Loofass is a
general in Grangeil and best friends with Gyaricke and is the last of the 3
Grangeil Slayers. Mervina is the daughter of the previous Peace Maintenance
army Vice-Commander and is now still serving the army. Sheris is the princess
and only Slayer of Sheriltia.

-->>Bactor
Bactor is a captain in Grangeil, he's not very happy with Gyaricke and
Loofass' positions and status in Grangeil but despite so, he still keeps to
his own boundaries. You fight him at the Coliseum as well as the optional
dungeon.


<First appearance in Growlanser VI>

-->>Shuweizer
Shuweizer is the leader of the Red Wolf army. He wears red, and because he is
so powerful, enemies fear him and call him the Red Wolf. Even though the
Esgrenz continent has never met with much screeper attacks, Shuweizer showed
in later parts of the game in fights along with Merklich's party as well as
unseen battles such as protecting a merchant that he's definitely stronger
than the Slayers in Goat Land by being able to take on pawn, rook and even
Knight screepers with no big problems. In the end, he gave the Monopolis
president position to his younger sister Anita and chose to take the "lower"
status by continuing as Red Wolf leader and working for the benefits of the
Monopolis company.

-->>Maxwell
The 2nd son of the King of Hingistan, Maxwell offered suggestions to his
father in changing the political and economical approaches to make the kingdom
follow a democracy ruling just like the neighbouring countries. However, the
king refused to listen to him and he left the castle to join the Monopolis.
His skills earned him a position under Shuweizer's Red Wolf Army. However,
that did not last too long as he betrayed orders by rescuing Iristelessa.
Thereafter, he created the Resistance while keeping his identity a secret.

-->>Brandole
President of the Monopolis. In actuality, the Infinitor has taken over his
body. Not much is known of him apart from that he is the father of Shuweizer
and Anita and from Anita's comments, he was a kind man.

-->>Commander 13
Originally Infinitor's subordinate. He took part in a losing fight against
the 1st Spirit maiden and ended up being caught. After much discussions and
persuasions, he decided to join on her side and betrayed the Infinitor. After
the long fight, they managed to seal the Infinitor inside the Dragon orb.

he declared that the mission of the clones from then on was to protect the
Spirit maiden and the Dragon orb.

---Bedding Dogs---                                                       [DO1]

The bedding dog(fu-ton i-nu) in VI is a totally optional side feature that is
rather similar to the fairy contest in V. It doesn't matter at all if you've
not played V before, either you wish to get more Rana fruits and seeds for
increasing Yurry stats or it's really just for the fun of it. The dogs are
pretty funny, but my real dog is cuter.

Alright, basically, the first time you reach Totour, head over to the cave
and exmaine the bedding dog. Talk to Hazegorou and he will mention about
breeders. Leave the village and the next time you drop by Totour as required
by the main game, talk to him again. Choose to become a breeder and you get to
choose the dog you want. You just need to take care of the dog, not breed
them, no worries.

 ------------
|MAIN OPTIONS|
 ------------

Talk to Hazegorou to bring up the menu.

-Go for a walk
-Advice

-->Go for a walk
Go for a walk means the party will separate and the dog will follow Merk
around. Take the dog outside the village and defeat monsters for him to earn
EXP and level up. The areas you can go are the Noschval tunnel and the area
from Totour to the ship landing point to the east. The stronger your dog
become, so will the enemies. There are altogether 3 main levels of enemies
in terms of difficulty(I don't think a lot of people have the patience to go
further than that).

-->Advice
Here, Hazegorou will give you advice on various sections of being a good
breeder.

Once you have chosen to go for a walk, talk to Hazegorou to bring up the main
options.

-Place dog in his care
-Use points
-Do a job
-Advice

-->Place dog in his care
End the walk and have your dog return back to dog's lair.

-->Do a job
Do a job: There are 4 jobs you can do, and this is really the only fixed way
to earn your service points. What job you get is random, so accept it and if
you don't want that particular one, talk to him again and choose to cancel.

1)Deliver goods from Hazegorou to man at the house near the ship landing point
2)Deliver goods from man at house near ship landing point to Hazegorou
3)Search for dropped item
4)Hunting

1 and 2 are really just going from point 1 to point 2 and vice versa. The ship
landing point is to the east of Totour. One thing to note is that while you
are carrying the goods, Merklich's movement will become very slow. Both 1 and
2 gives 10 service points each when completed.

3 is to bring your dog around the area between the ship landing point and
Totour village to search for the lost item that has been buried by snow. When
you dog locates the item, 2 red exclamation marks will appear above his head
and he will start to dig. This job gives 15 service points and can be easy or
difficult depending on how lucky you are. The positions aren't fixed, so you
really have to bring your doggy around until he sniffs it up.

4 requires you to kill monsters to get their parts. The earlier requirement
is to get the Gulpper's tongue and the later one is to get the Floater's
shell. The gulpper has a tendency to suck Yurry in and eat her, so whenever
that happens, make sure you kill it quickly. Anyway, you'll automatically get
the stuff when you kill the monster. The max amount you can carry is 10, so
once you have met that number, go back and talk to Hazegorou and choose to end
the job and he will give you 10 service points(number of points = number of
items collected).

-->Use points
Select this and you can use your points to feed the dog various type of food
as well as rent toys for him to play with.


Now for contest related stuff. After you have chosen to become a breeder, head
over to Leystan and talk to the man near the entrance. Choose to tell him
about Hazegorou at Totour. He will then head to Totour and become your dog's
technique trainer. Go talk to him(he's at the inn) and choose from the list of
dance techniques to teach your dog. You'll need service points for this
section.

Also, the lady at the inn counter will play music for the dog to listen to.
But that require service points as well.

 -------------
|CONTEST ITEMS|
 -------------

With the dog in Merk's party, talk to the woman standing near Hazegorou to
participate in the contest. The 2nd option allows her to determine the dog's
loyalty to Merk.

There are 4 contests to take part in:

-Dog Race
-Dance
-Gobbling oddity
-Ball searching

-->Dog Race

The dog race is the simplest game to play.
1)Circle button  : Instruct the dog to dash
2)X button       : Instruct dog to run normally(stop dashing)
3)Triangle button: Recover stamina

Dashing will cause the stamina gauge at the top right corner to deplete very
fast, so I wouldn't recommend that. Just have the dog run normally while you
press the Triangle button repeatedly to recover his stamina.

-->Dance

Take part in this only after you have the dog master all of the dance
techniques.

Below is the list of dance items that you can have your dog learn in order to
stand a better chance of winning:

1)Step Dance: As the dog progress through learning the dance techniques, the
trainer will teach him this.

2)Pretty Dance: Once step dance is learn, talk to the woman at the inn
counter(listen to music->chat).

3)Para Para Dance: As the dog progresses through the later stages of dance
techniques, the trainer will teach him this.

4)Athletic Dance: Hire Carry to Zaaranba and talk to the first boy on the left
row and pay him 100 to buy the book.

5)Tap Dance: Hire Carry to Guylanuck, enter and at the first screen examine
the pile of crates near the entrance to find the illustration of the tap dance
doggy.

6)Revolving Dance: Choose to take the dog for a walk, then go into Noschval
tunnel and examine the ice wall at the upper left screen. Go back to Totour
and talk to the man at the entrance. Choose to tell him about the ice wall.
Switch screens and talk to him again. Hire Carry over to Juwaina and buy the
snapdragon oil from the item store. Go back to the ice wall and examine it,
then use the oil and Merklich will start his totorara song(how can anyone
remember how to sing that crappy song?) without voice acting of course. Go in
and finish off the enemies. Since they are at Level 37, it would be wise to
have the dog defend while you finish them off with Merklich alone. Bring the
dog over to the magic symbol on the left of the screen. If questions marks
start appearing but no exclamation ones, that means the dog is not ready to
learn it as yet.

7)Break Dance: After revolving dance is learnt, Hire Carry to Juwaina and
talk to the woman in yellow.

For the contest itself, you are supposed to attach a certain dance to each
button(Circle, Triangle and X). The list will show how much stamina the dog
has as well as how much stamina each dance will burn off. So make sure your
dog has got the stamina for the 3 dance sections.

Once the music starts playing, press the button which represents the dance
you want the dog to perform within 2 seconds(you only need to press it once).
Repeat this for the remaining 2 buttons. The one with the highest accumulated
scores for all 3 dance sections will win.

-->Gobbling oddity

This contest tests the courage and eating skills of the dog. Once the match
starts, tap the Circle button repeatedly to have Merk encourage the dog to eat
the gels. When the gauge on the upper right screen fills up, that represents
the dog has eaten up 1 gel. When the dog freaks out, he will run away, so have
Merk chase after him and talk to him(Circle button) and he will return back to
the original position and start eating again. The one who ate the most gels
will win.

-->Ball searching

This is rather frustrating and plays similarly to FFIX's chocobo hot and cold.
X button instructs the dog to search/sniff(you only have 15 tries). Depending
on where the ball is located, he will give various responses:

Bark once: Very far
Bark twice: Far
2 exclamation marks+bark once: Normal distance
2 exclamation marks+bark twice: Near
2 exclamation marks+bark thrice: Very near
Music note+bark thrice: At feet

The idea here is to have the dog run to any position and press X, confirm to
search. If question marks or sweat drops comes out then search is a failure.
Otherwise, check out which direction the doggy is facing and his responses.
An example:


   D ->(1)->->(2)->->(3)->->(4)

D is the position of the dog when you have him search and the direction of
the arrows is the direction he faces after search is done. This means that the
ball is located in a position along that line. So if his response is two !!
and two barks, the ball is most likely around position (2), and if it is just
two barks then it's most likely around position (4). Once the position is
located(with the music note response), press Circle to have him dig. Continue
the process. The one who dug out the highest amount of balls win.

Once all contest items are done with your dog as the victor, Hazegorou will
challenge your dog with his champion Peke. Talk to the woman and the option
to accept the challenge should be available.

-->Champion match

This is a one-on-one fight, but not in your normal battle style. Each dog has
150HP, 10 chances of using Boost and 1 defend turn and 1 attack turn. When
it's Peke's turn to attack, your dog will have his defending turn, and vice
versa. If your dog is trained well, he will be able to identity which
direction Peke is attacking from as well as which direction Peke's guard is
lacking without using boost. The dog with 0HP loses.


Overall, you will need to train your dog well before he can learn the various
stuff and win in the contests. I'll list my dog's stats and the contest
results for your reference below to give you an idea of when you can take part
in the contest with hopes of winning:

--Overall
Dog  : Tetsu
LV   : 30

--Stats
Discipline       : 57
Determination    : 57
Sniffing ability : 57
Rhythm           : 81

--Contest results
Dog race        : start with around 90% of stamina gauge(00)
Dance           : 28 points
Gel eating      : 5 Gels
Ball searching  : 5 balls
Fight with Peke : defeated Peke with 80+HP left


-->Extras

1)Rana fruits and seeds
Hazegorou will give Merk one Rana seed for every level the bedding dog gained.
At level 10, he'll give a Rana fruit. Winning each contest item will get you
a Rana fruit as the prize as well.

2)Dog toy: Sled
When you try to rent the sled(5 points), Hazegorou will tell you that he has
not received it yet. Go to the ship landing point(with your normal party) to
the east and choose to board the ship over to the Grangeil side. Enter the
inn and ask the innkeeper about the package. Go to the peace maintainence
army base and on the 2nd screen, knock on the green door at the very end. Go
back to Totour and talk to Hazegorou and he will tell you the sled arrived and
give you 20 service points as expression of thanks.

3)Strongest weapon
Once you get to fight Peke, defeat him and you'll get the dog's strongest
jaw weapon.

4)Strongest armor
To make your dog the guard dog of hell with the cerberus collar, use the
snapdragon perfume oil at the ice wall at the noschval tunnel, one of the
monsters in there is holding the strongest armor, but you really have to
defeat all to know which is the one. I got it from the last monster I killed
so maybe you really need to kill all to get it.

---Optional Dungeon---                                                    [P1]

The Dungeon Lady and Girl sisters combination returns in VI with the dungeon
master rod and sealed dungeon devil plot. You'll have go around searching for
them to trigger various events which will eventually make your optional
dungeon available.

-Wartree
-Dastis Libray
-Leystan
-Royferon
-Dastis dump area
-Go out of Dastis and enter again
-Lenocks Research Center
-Shizaaz
-Lenocks Research Center
-Royferon graveyard
-Shizaaz(Enter, examine the well and leave the village)
-Enter Shizaaz again and examine the well, you should get a message saying
that you hear construction noises from below.

After the soaring ship is accessible, the dungeon will be available as well.
After the short event, talk to the dungeon girl and choose to enter the
dungeon.

-->Dungeon structure and enemies

The dungeon has a total of 50 levels. Each floor comes in the form of a big
square area with 9 compartments. One of these compartments has the stairs
which goes down to the next level and each floor has treasure chests lying
around. Each level is generated randomly so the items and layout of treasure
chests and ladders will always be different. All items I picked up through the
dungeon are gems, jewels and manuals/scrolls and in very rare occasions an
eclipse mirror and apples(yes, I finally managed to clear all enemies on every
level).

As for the enemies, there are 5 types.

1)Demon Lord    : Starts off on floor 1 at level 60
2)Samaeru       : Starts off on floor 1 at Level 59
3)Mythril Golem : Starts off on floor 1 at Level 61
4)Gold Gel      : Appearance is random
5)Soul          : Appearance is random

4 and 5 have 3 more levels than the demon lord of that particular floor you
are located at(e.g: demon lord is at lv 70, then soul/gold gel is at lv 73 or
so).

With every 2 floors, the levels of the demon lord, samaeru and mythril golem
will increase by 1 level, so at the 3rd floor, the demon lord will be at level
61, and therefore on the 49th floor, they will be at level [(50/2)+60]-1= 84.
Same format goes for the others.

For floors 1 to 9, there are 6 enemies on each floor,
for floors 11 to 19, there are 9 enemies on each floor,
for floors 21 to 29, there are 12 enemies on each floor,
for floors 31-39, there are 12 enemies on each floor,
for floors 41-49, there are 15 enemies on each floor

For every 10 floors you complete, you can exit(the dungeon girl will inform
you she has binded up the ladder) and restock/heal, and when you asked to
enter the dungeon again, you will continue from where you left off earlier.
But remember, only every 10 floors after defeating the boss.

Take note that even when you have completed the dungeon up till 50th floor,
after you exit and return, you'll still end up at level 40.

-->Completing the dungeon

There are 2 ways you can complete the dungeon to reach the 50th floor.

1)The easy way: ignore character levels and enemies and treasure chests and
head straight for the ladder leading to the next floor. This can be difficult
especially when you reach the lower levels because I would presume you will
still be around levels 65 or so when the enemies are at 80. You can have
someone with high def coupled with def increasing gems as well as the Protect
status magic and have him(since the girls are weaker) use decoy and defend to
lure the enemies while you run to your ladder(you can use slep's blood if you
can spare it). It is definitely possible to reach the 50th floor by using this
trick, but don't expect it to go smoothly always.

One thing to note is that you still need at least 30000mil to buy a blessing
bell from the dungeon lady(I believe it is possible to steal from the enemies
here, but since I never and won't intend to use the stealing ability I will
never know, therefore you will have to try that out for yourself) and the soul
battle over at the coliseum requires you to pay 30000mil for 1 battle(I
presume you do all these things so you can level up your characters and
complete the optional stuff in the game), so unless you have got chunks and
chunks of mil, I wouldn't recommend using this method. Using cheats is another
issue though, but I've got nothing to do with those, and you can be fully
assured that this faq and all information are wrought without any cheatcodes
(how to when I don't even own the necessary items or devices or whatever they
call them?).

2)The tough way: Clearing enemies on the levels, which allow your characters
to gain the necessary EXP points as well as the money to buy the blessing
bells and take part in the coliseum matches. If you opted for this way, be
prepared to spend anything between 2 to 4 hours. You can do it your way, but
here is how I completed mine:

a)I used Merk, Zeon, Wendy and Rukias

b)Used all the money I have at this point in the game on the soul bonus
battles at the coliseum and got my characters to level 65/66(I would recommend
at least level 60)

c)Combine and stack the appropriate gem bonuses for all 4 characters(I
equipped zeon with a lv 4 mil up bonus to increase the amount of mil obtained
from enemies)

d)All 4 characters of mine have the Inferno skill, HP and MP absorb, HP and
MP regenerating skills(you can copy from one who has the skill or you can
fight at the vision match at the coliseum to get the necessary scrolls).

e)All 4 characters have their strongest weapon/armor equipped(apart from
rukias of whom I have not gotten his strongest weapon yet)

f)Allowed Merk to learn the Attack status magic till level 9(I think you
already know, using the limit removal item, you can replicate plates), Wendy
to learn the Protect status magic till level 9, Rukias to learn Grow-cure to
level 5 and Zeon to learn Cycle-up level 7(by making use of the flow paths
bonus on a level 5 plate). It doesn't matter if you make one character learn
all the above magic, but for my case I spread it out among my characters so
the burden of MP usage will be even.

g)Under the AI tactics section, turned off all magic usage for all characters
apart from cure, fine(a must), healing, grow-cure/grow-healing, and of which I
restrict the usage frequencies to 1. I also set the casting of magic to be
manually controlled(meaning the menu will pop up to get my instructions to
cast the magic on who when the character has finished chanting)

h)Manually use Attack, protect and Cycle up on all 4 characters

i)Enter the dungeon/go to the next floor

j)Use the right analogue stick to check out where the Samaeru monsters are
located and if possible, to always attack and kill them off first since their
magic can be very dangerous with consecutive chants.

k)Defeat the remaining enemies

l)Open all treasure chests

m)repeat from steps h-l

Notes:
-It may be good to bring along nectars or at least have one character
learn the Raise magic because though we seldom see the sudden death attack
melee technique work, but the samaeru monsters here are of high levels, I've
got Merk die immediately to that attack once.
-Have patience when fighting the mythril golems because they like to use the
piercing melee technique which takes around 5 seconds to execute...

By doing all of the above steps, I've not used any items for all 50 levels
because the hp/mp absorb and regenerate did their work so the depleted HP and
MP are refilled back, and my rukias(the only one who has the fine magic turned
on) will automatically chant fine to heal any faint status. I seldom use
Inferno because you can only use it 5 times and have to rest at inn to restore
it back. Apart from step h, I did not use any magic unless I encounter the
soul monster(which can only be defeated via magic). It may be troublesome to
have to re-cast the status magic before you proceed to the next floor, but it
will make things easier and faster in the long run.

Because I stick to clearing all enemies on each level, the pace by which my
characters gain levels are consistant with the increase in enemies levels as
I go further down the dungeon, allowing me to have no problems in defeating
the enemies on each consecutive floor(i.e: it will take a lot of effort and
time to defeat level 75 monsters when you are only at 65). Therefore, by the
time I reached floor 49, the demon lord is at level 84, and my characters are
at levels 81-82, nice. And with the money I have earned from fighting through
all the floors, I buy blessing bells and use them, exit the dungeon and
re-enter the dungeon(starting at floor 40) to fight enemies and gain more
levels(very easily, making the coliseum soul battles unnecessary unless you
have extra money and want to save time) until floor 50 and buy bells again and
repeat until I've had enough with the entire process.


-->Dungeon Bosses

You'll have to fight a boss on floors 10, 20, 30, 40 and 50 before the event
will trigger whereby you can return back to the surface without using Return
magic. The bosses are really wimps compared to the normal enemies in the
dungeon.

10th floor: Giant Villager
This is a real joke. All you have to do is throw some punches and the fight
will end because...the villager don't know how to fight at all. You'll get the
[Rare item: Casual Clothing Paper Model] which you can bring to Yarjen to get
another of Yurry's costumes done. Go and examine the golden treasure chest at
the very end of the room to get the 'Villager Buster' title.

P/S: You will unlock the title selection option over at the Coliseum whereby
you can choose various titles for Merk, which will show on his target info
box.

20th floor: Big Gel
This is another comedy battle. Make use of what Yurry mentioned about gels
being weak against fire and keep chanting Fire Arrow. The gel should die very
soon. Go and examine the golden treasure chest to get the 'Gel Buster' title.

30th floor: Bactor
This is very easy as well. Just keep attacking him and halfway through, the
dungeon lady will turn Bactor into a giant. Still, he doesn't pose any threat
at all. After the fight, examine the gold chest to get 'Great Bactor' title.

40th floor: Master Guardian Spriggan
Unlike the previous boss battles, this one is a serious fight. Try to keep
characters with low HP away from it because it can use sonic wave and that
will really hurt low def characters. Always have someone ready to cast Grow-
healing. Physical and magic attacks both work pretty well. After the battle,
examine the gold chest to get 'Guardian Buster' title.

50th floor: Big Pawn
This is actually easier than spriggan in my opinion. This thing can use 
Earthquake so once again make sure a level 6 grow-healing is ready at all
times. Other than earthquake, it will just hit at one character(just like
your normal pawn screeper, difference being it's a big-sized one). Equipping
the Penetrating gems for your melee characters is strongly recommended here.
After the battle is over, examine the gold chest to get the 'Dungeon Buster'
title.

The 3 normal red treasures chests on the left and right side give different
types of gems the 1st time you clear the dungeon. On my 2nd time(exit the
dungeon and re-enter again starting at floor 40), I got 2 blessing bells, but
on my 3rd time, it reset back to random gems and manuals/scrolls again.

Anyway, once you have completed the entire dungeon, the dungeon lady will
remain at the 50th floor and offer to sell you items to save up money for the
construction of her next dungeon. A list of the items she is selling:

P/S: Costs of items are based on my own gameplay and may not be the same for
yours since Yurry have got an ability which can decrease item costs(by using
her charm etc) and I'm not sure whether that will affect the dungeon lady as
well.

-->Plot

I'll just summarize this game's optional dungeon plot for those who are
interested:

Basically the dungeon lady will be going through a test to see if she has the
qualifications to become the dungeon master. Her previous mock test was marked
as failure because it has only 11 floors with no bosses(if you've played GV,
that's the optional dungeon this reference is of). Therefore, she decided to
travel to the other continent to gather up information and materials.

While researching for information, no one really bothered about her questions
and passion for building the most wonderful dungeon, casting her weird looks
and saying she's bizzare.

She then attempted to start looking for materials instead of wasting time
obtaining insight from people. In her despair, she remembered the dungeon
master rod from her village(which is not mentioned where is it located) and
made an attempt to steal it. Using it, she built a dungeon at Shizaaz's well
while her younger sister -the dungeon girl- requests Merk's party to help out
in persuading the dungeon lady to return the rod. 

She mentioned about the legend of the dungeon devil which is sealed up inside
the rod. At the last floor of the dungeon, the dungeon devil possessed the
dungeon lady and attempted to free him/itself. Due to the feats of Merk and
his party, that turned out unsuccessful, but he/it promised that there will be
a next time.

A sidenote being that the dungeon lady thinks that fairies are her sworn
enemies due to an experience with what she calls a blue devil. And it's pretty
obvious that the loud and rude fairy she's talking about is Corin, and if you
brought Zeon along to Royferon for the 2nd time to locate the dungeon lady,
you will get an extra conversation.

---Yurry + costumes---                                                    [Y1]

A post on the message board made me realize that I forgot to include this in
the faq. After another replay, I finally got the information in place.

(1)Luxurious red kimono(Akai gouka no kimono)
  -Yurry has this right from the beginning

(4)Green dainty kimono(midori-iro no usude no kimono)
  -Have Yurry wear (3) and talk to the woman at Yarjen(house beside the
   equipment shop)

(5)Active Dress
   -After Mission 10, talk to the Potrad nearest to the entrance. He will give
    Merk the model paper, bring it to the woman in Yarjen(house beside the

--Miscellaneous--                                                        [MS1]

1)On your 2nd trip to the Peace Maintenance Army to ask for help in destroying
the Energy Tower, there are differences in the scenes and conversations
depending on whether you've talked to Fanil before you approach Zeon at the
main gate. If you did, she will join immediately as NPC. If you did not talk
to her, you will have to go back to Makinus to remove Zeon from your party and
go back to talk to her before you can begin doing Zeon's side quest.

2)You can give a Naton fruit(get it from the tree northwest of Wartree) to the
man in L'Hingis(he is standing near the inn) and get an Advanced Penetrating
Gem. I think it's not really necessary unless you are THAT short of money to
buy it at the item store.

3)The Incantator in Wartree also asks for a Naton fruit in exchange for
his/her services in changing Merk's personality. You can buy perfumes at
Zeldock and perfumed oil at Juwaina. All except Snapdragon and Whiterose(which
do nothing personality related but you know they have their own uses in the
game) come in batches of 9. Each bottle used will give a slight effect in
whatever change in personality that you asked for. The more you use, the
greater the total effect. Simple yeah?

There will be encounters while moving around the field, and various enemies
will wander around. On fields whereby towns and villages are, various commands
can be used when enemies appear.

View of field map:
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                     | Green=NPC

                     | represented by a green bar, when the green bar is gone,
                     | magic can be cast
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Target marker:
When a character or enemy approaches, there will be a marker above his/her
head. When the marker appears, press Circle button to talk to attack. The L1
and R1 button can be used to change targets.

the Circle button to lock on target and start attacking.

For conversation: Allies and characters in towns/villages are represented by
green markers. Press Circle to talk.

Using commands on the field:

there are not battles, there may be situations whereby Attack, Move, Defend,
Skills etc cannot be used. Single target attack magic cannot be used as well.

start. It is possible to avoid battles by observing enemy positions and
successful movement commands.

Facilities in towns and villages:
There are facilities such as shops in towns, villages and castles. It will
prove beneficial to encounters and adventures. **Just like the outside fields,
battles may occur in cities.

**Just a sidenote to let you know that what they meant are mission battles,
there's no monsters or encounters inside towns and cities.

Buildings and houses:
There are buildings and houses in cities and villages. It is possible to
talk to people in them by standing before the doors and pressing the Circle
button. Important information may be obtained from conversations, be sure to
listen carefully to them. There are also situations whereby one can enter
them.

Inn:
Staying at an inn replenishes HP and MP to full and allows data save as well.
Furthermore, it may be required for plot progress. **It's also possible to
call Yurry out at the inn.

**This won't make sense until you play the game, basically it's an option to
change Yurry's costumes and increase her parameters using Rana fruits and
seeds.

Shop:
For shops, there are weapon.armor shops as well as the item shops that sell
goods and gems. Weapon and armor doesn't increase attack and defense ability,
they also give skill plates. Gems are crucial to the the gems combination
option. Making full use of all these can strengthen characters significantly.

Weapons: When equipped, increase attack power. Also give weapon related skill
plates.
Armor: When equipped, increase defense ability. Also give armor related skill
plates.
Goods: Ranging from healing items to others that can prove very useful
Gems: When equipped, gives the listed special effects. It is possible to

Equipping weapons and armor require the necessary STR. In cases whereby the
STR stat is insufficient, ability of characters will go down as a form of
penalty. For weapons, ATW will go up. For armor, MOV will go up.

Order of skill plates:
At the time of purchasing or selecting the equipment option at the command
menu allows choice in the order of obtaining skill plates. At the list which
shows the plate, use the d-pad or left analogue stick to choose the desired
skill plate and press Circle to confirm. In situations whereby there are 3
plates, continue on to choose the 2nd plate.


[Battle, Pg 14-17]

Control the protagonist and give commands responding to battle needs.

Battle basics:
Enemies move around on the field map and player controls the protagonist
while other party members act automatically. It is impossible to control
other party members directly, so give commands from the Command menu to
defeat the enemies.

Battle Type:
There are 2 types of battle. One is the normal field battle, while the other
is the mission battle which affects the game's plot.

Normal battles:
Due to enemies moving around, battles may start anytime. The end battle and
results screen won't emerge. Defeating enemies gives money and the same
experience points to all members. However, only the one who strikes the last
blow to an enemy gets the technique points given by that particular enemy.

Mission battles: Plays a part in the story plot. Defeating all enemies or
meeting the victory conditions will end the battle. Results screen will show
and bonus experience points can be obtained.

The escape mode:
Pressing down the R2 button during a battle triggers the escape mode. In this
mode all party members will stop all actions and commands and follow the
protagonist.

**Battling and moving:
On the field, when the protagonist and party members start to attack(attack
magic, attack status magic, attack command), battle begins. Party members will
act automatically.

**If you read on, you'll understand what this section means.

Conditions that trigger the start of a battle:
-Protagonist starts to attack
-Command party member to start to attack
-Enemy attack any member of the party
-Start of mission battles

Movement during battles:
Battles are in real time. The attack window and charge time bar shows the time
remaining to next action. Press the SELECT button to turn the main window on
and off.

Attack window and charge time:
When the yellow Atack window gauge(ATW) bar reduces to 0, next action/command
can be performed. Magic is the same and the charge time(CT) gauge is
represented by a green bar. When it reaches 0, this implies 1 magic level has
finished chanting. The length of gauge depends on the action/command that has
been selected.

Progress of magic usage:
Magic can be used in towns and fields but they require certain specific
procedures. Magic chanted outside of battles can be cast immediately. MP
usage remains the same for all levels(Both level 1 Cure and level 5 Cure uses
the same amount of MP, which is 6).

1)Select magic:
Select Magic in the command menu and move up and down the list with d-pad or
the left analogue stick. Use R2 and L2 buttons to scroll down the list.

2)Choosing the level:
Next, choose the level of magic to be chanted. The higher the level, the
higher the effects and chant time.

3)Start of chanting:
Choose the target after selecting the magic level. Use the d-pad or left
analogue stick to move the cursor. The CT gauge will decrease and when it
is gone, chanting is done.

To stop chanting, use the Triangle button to bring up the Command menu. To
select other commands after canceling, choose 'Stop', to continue chanting
to higher levels that are available, choose 'Continue'. Magic that has been
chanted above level 1 can be cast at any time.

4)End of chanting:
When a character finish chanting, the casting screen will pop up. Select the
character/enemy to use the magic on. Choosing 'Stop' will allow other commands
to be given, but the chanting bar will be gone, so please take note of that.
'Wait' will command the character to retain the chanting bar and wait, using
the Triangle button to bring up the menu at any time to have the character
cast the magic.

Results screen after battle:
Clearing a mission will bring up the results screen. Depending on the mission
clear contents, 3 diffrent ranks are obtained. The clear bonus includes
money, experience points as well as technique points.

1)Mission complete: complete all required conditions. Highest clear bonus is
obtained.

2)Mission clear: meet clear conditions. Normal clear bonus is obtained.

3)Mission failed: did not meet clear conditions nor game over conditions,
the least amount of clear bonus is obtained.

Game Over:
Whether in normal or mission battles, it will be game over when all party
members are defeated. There are also situations of meeting game over
conditions in the middle of a battle. In the case of a game over for mission
battles, choosing the CONTINUE option at the title screen allows a retry.

Apart from enchant gems, there are also the jewel stones that can't be
equipped. The stones can't be used normally but when 2 jewel stones are
combined together, a new enchant gem can be created.

Combining with jewel stones:
When an enchant gem is set as the main gem and a jewel stone as the
additional gem, random results are obtained(nothing will happen if their
positions are reversed). Gem levels increasing and additional abilities and
effects emerging are some of the results that can be achieved.

[Ability Tree, Pg 30-31]
Press the Square button to bring up the Ability tree screen. This screen
allows attachment and mastery of skill and technique plates.

Techique plates and the ability tree:
The ability tree is where one can freely attach plates and learn skills and
magic by earning technique points from battles. The obtained technique
points flow from the left to right, increasing levels of the plates.

Ability tree screen:

*This section comes with an image and numeral pointers.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1) Active flow     | Connections that are represented by the yellow outline
                   | shows the current active flow. Technique points obtained
                   | are accumulated and added onto this flow
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2) Skill plates    | Each hexagon is a skill plate. Pressing Circle button at
                   | any empty space allow attachment of plates. Orange:Magic,
                   | Green: Special skills, Blue: Skill techniques
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3) Starting point  | The verticle line on the left represents the starting 
   of flow         | point of the flow. Technique points obtained are added
                   | onto all plates that are connected via the arrow marks.
                   | The starting point of the flow differs according to the
                   | current equipped weapons and armor
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
4) Spare technique | Technique points that are currently being stocked up
   points          |
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
5) Accumulated pts | The total accumulated points for the selected plate. When
                   | MAX is reached, the plate gains 1 level
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
6) Level           | Levels of the various plates. Once they reach the maximum
                   | level, they cannot be further increased
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
7) Technique       | The meter showing currently accumulated technique points.
   points meter    | When bar reaches MAX, plate level increase by 1
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
8) Direction of    | Shows the various plate links. Attaching another plate 
   plate linking   | at the arrow marks will set up the flow through that
                   | plate. The direction of arrows can be changed to up or
                   | down and there are also cases whereby they can be toggled
                   | freely
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Mastering abilities:

Plates can be attached at an empty space on the ability tree. Plates have
levels and they can be used when the level starts at 1.

Development of plates:
Technique points are divided equally among all plates that the active flow
passes through. Due to that, plates may take a long time level up, so please
take note. When there are no connected plates, the technique points will be
stocked up.

Rules of active flow:
The color of the arrows at the leftmost side of the tree correspond to the
ones for equipped weapons and armor. Each equipped weapon and armor will 
determine the flow's starting point. Plates with the active flow passing
through them gets a +1 level bonus(highest is +2 levels bonus). The final
level will be the addition of the original level of the plate+the bonus.

Plate sub-menu:
Moving the cursor on an attached plate and pressing the Circle button brings
up the sub menu. For plates with arrow links that can be toggled, there is an
option here to do that. There are also different types of items that can be
used to manipulate the direction of links and position of plates.

Toggling direction of links:
The direction of active flow through the plates can be toggled up and down.
Select a plate, choose the direction and confirming it will change the flow
direction.

Items:
There are items for changing link direction, changing positions of plates, 
as well as adding on extra technique points to plates and so on to manipulate
the plate connections and usage of technique points.

==============================================================================

---Q&A---

I've got a habit of putting a Q&A section in my faqs, so this is no exception.

Q: Do you recommend this game?
A: If you've played V and like it, then go ahead and get this. If not, you'd
better not grab it the moment you see it in an import store and wound up
wanting to kick yourself for buying it. It's not perfect but definitely a
very good game IMO(incidentally my fav Growlanser), so it really depends on
what are you looking for because if you want another Growlanser II
(incidentally my least fav Growlanser), it's better to look somewhere else. A
good rule of thumb is: DON'T listen to ANYONE and test it for yourself before
you make a decision on whether you want to get it or not.

Q: Do I need to play the previous Growlansers to know what's going on in this
game?
A: No. Growlanser VI has nothing to do with G1-4 but it is the direct sequel
to Growlanser V. For those who have played V before, VI will definitely be
more familiar and perhaps answer some of your left-over doubts and questions.
For those who did not, there are explanations by characters in the game
regarding related events that happened in V so you don't have to worry about
getting lost, but if you want an extra reference/explanation, do refer to the
'Characters' section of this faq but as expected, know that there are full
spoilers there.

Q: They should have made the mission complete conditions clearer. Bleh. 
A: The conditions listed in your pop-up before any mission battle begins are
the CLEAR conditions == allowing you to get mission clears. Mission completes
are OPTIONAL because:

1)It does not determine your plot/storyline advancement at all
2)The stuff you get out from them are NOT necessities for you to finish the
game with your desired ending(s).

In such cases, we call those benefits we get from mission completes HIDDEN
BONUSES. So I hope you won't expect a game to give you clear or even step by
step instructions on how to get hidden bonuses.

Q: How many endings are there?
A: Merk, Yurry, Wendy, Rukias, Irist, Hofman, Anita, Zeon, Neilis. That's 9.

Q: Are the endings easy to get?
A: The side quests are the main thing which can help boost the affection
levels. So long as you have COMPLETED the side quest for a certain character,
you can still get his/her ending even if his/her relationship bar is at green.
But if you did not do their side quests, you can't get an ending even if the
bar is red(blue->black->green->red).

Q: I haven't done Wendy's side quest, nor have I met the dungeon lady at
Royferon, and now the city is destroyed!
A: Do everything you want at Royferon and L'Hingis before the Energy Tower
event(mission 46).

Q: HELP! I can't get <insert name>'s affection to red!
A: You shouldn't have any problems getting them to red if you have been nice
and all. I know Hofman is extremely hard to please(at least for me) but some
dandy books(3-4) should do the trick to reach a red for him. As mentioned
before, fight at the Coliseum. If you didn't mess up too much throughout your
entire game by failing every mission and choosing every single wrong replies,
winning just a couple of matches a.k.a mission completes should allow maximum
ratings in no time at all. What's better yet, even playable characters whom
you did not bring along to fight at the Coliseum will gain those friendship
points as well.

Q: What happened to Shuweizer?
A: Apparantly, Shayer used a pod to save him(as with Brandole ordering Merk to
be put into the pod when he nearly died protecting Irist) but he lost the
ability to travel through time. Due to the high risk of his body being used as
the next host for Infinitor after Brandole, he decided to play along with
everyone's belief that he is dead and keep his identity a secret.

Q: I NEED blessing bells, where?
A: Sad to say that for this game, I have explored around and only found 1
place to get "infinite" blessing bells: the dungeon lady sells it at floor 50
of the optional dungeon, and of course you will need infinite money. Look
under the optional dungeon section of this faq for more explanation.

Q: What can the game clear data be used for?
A: The appendix option will be available. Loading the data will allow you to
replay the game with your gems, skills, weapons/armor and all items(apart from
those under rare items menu) brought over to the new game. Character levels
will be reset to lv 1, take note that equipping the strong weapons and armor
straight away will give plenty of MOV and ATW penalty so...don't.

Q: Do they have an official strategy guide for this game?
A: They do. But I don't have it, and don't intend to get it.

Q: I'm gonna play this game but I have not played V before, would you mind
giving me the save file so I can use it to get Zeon's strongest equipment?
A: After a nice explanation from a fellow gamer via email, I have to say that
I'm sorry but I do not have the means(I only have my PS2 console, the
necessary connecters, my normal PS2 memory card, my controllers and the game)
of making my save files available unless I send my memory card over, which is
obviously out of question.
