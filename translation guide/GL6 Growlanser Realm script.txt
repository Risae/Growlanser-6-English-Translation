I assume those reading this have played Growlanser: Heritage of War, English version of Growlanser V: Generations. Here are some notes on names.

Zeonsilt - was named Haschen in HoW. I will stick with Zeonsilt here.
Lottey - was Lily in HoW
Miranda - was Mira in HoW
S-Class Mission - was called "Priority 1 Mission" in HoW
Dragon Vein - was called "Ley Line" in HoW
Randall - it's Randy in JP version. Using Randall just for personal preference
Zero Cell - it's called "#1 Cell" in JP version but I'll keep it Zero Cell

Currently, this translation script contains only one playthrough. That means, to follow this script you will need to select the same dialog choices as I did, noted with (*).

Note: Mission battle numbers, titles, and complete/clear/failed criteria are not written ingame, but added by myself from information in the strategy guidebook.

Woman's voice:
...I feel a light.
Although it is faint, it is a light that will shine strongly.
It seems the elementary attainments are there, but it is too soon to judge by only that...

Woman:
It is nice to meet you.
I am speaking directly to your mind now.
I am looking for those who can save this world which is headed toward destruction.
It is possible that you are one of those warriors.
Therefore, will you let me observe you to see if you are the person I am looking for?

1) I don't mind (*)
2) I'm not interested

(you may choose to skip the character creation but you will disappoint her. to skip, go to 0001)

Woman:
First, please tell me your name.

(Merklich) (Press START or SQUARE to decide name. X or TRIANGLE to delete a character. L1 and R1 to move the cursor left and right. L2 and R2 to change character types)

Woman:
From now, you will show me inside your heart.
Please show me as what you ordinarily are.
It looks like this place is the imagined scenery in your mind.
Because I am not an inhabitant of this dream, I cannot intervene.
So then, I will have you show me your personality for a while.
All of your actions here will influence your abilities. Please consider well and act accordingly.

(First I'll list translation of the menu: Press TRIANGLE)

Soldier by the cave entrance:
...What shall I do?
It's becoming the time I promised to meet with her, but the next shift's guard hasn't come...
At such a time, just what should I do...?
(talk to him again)
What is it?
You! Can I ask you a favor?
Actually, I am guarding this altar, but it's been time for a shift change for a while now but no one has come. I'm going to end up keeping her waiting at the inn too long...
I'm sorry but could you call someone to change shifts?

Merklich:
1) I'll call someone (*)
2) I will stand watch myself
3) It has nothing to do with me

Soldier:
Thank you!
The guard's station is a building with a brown colored door. I'm sorry but please hurry!

(knocking on brown door in lower right)
Do you have business with the station?
Oh no! It's already that time?
Thank you for telling me!
I will send a guard right away so please tell him to wait a little.

(talk to guard by the cave again)
Soldier:
They said wait a little more? Damn, that's all I can do then...
Thank you for telling me. It can't be helped, so I will guard here a little longer.

(go inside inn and talk to girl in yellow)
Girl:
That person, he's late...

[Inform her that the guard will be late due to work?]
1) Yes (*)
2) No

Girl:
He will be late because of work? If that's so it can't be helped.
That person is always late, so I was going to lecture him that if he was going to be late this time, that we would part ways.
It looks like I was wrong. Thank you for telling me.

(check all the way back of the inn for Pearl Bead)

(checking book on the table in inn)
[There is a book called System Information. Will you read it?]
1) Yes (*)
2) No

[To move, point the left stick in any direction! When you hold down X with the left stick, you can run!
When there are several people to talk to, use L1 and R1 to move the marker to the character you want to talk to. With this you can even make your way through a complicated crowd!
When you press R1 and X simultaneously, you can skip messages! with this you can part from long stories!
If you press L1, L2, R1, R2, START, SELECT simultaneously, you can reset the game! This will shorten the time until loading!]

(exiting the inn)
Soldier:
I should inform the station...
A monster was discovered outside the village a while ago. I will tell the office.
It's only one creature, so I don't think it's a threat but please warn them.
You over there, you're a warrior. If you step out of here, be careful.

(talk to the lookout soldier by the cave)
Soldier:
Oh! You told my girlfriend about my situation!
Thank you! I'm truly saved!
This is a little token of thanks. It's only something I picked up, but please accept it!

+Obtained Pearl Bead!+

Soldier:
All right! When the next guard comes I will go meet my girlfriend! Thanks to you.

Guard in lower right:
Ah, it's an iron wall! No one can break through my defenses!
You're a warrior. Do you think you can break through me?
Well, it's better if you don't overexert yourself. My defense is like an ironwall, so I think just  challenging me is useless.

Merklich:
1) Challenge him (*)
2) Quit

Soldier:
Ohh. So you have confidence, huh?
If so, then make me give in with a fixed time.
You will attack by pressing CIRCLE. I will do nothing but guard your attacks.
If you press CIRCLE with the timing of the end of the attacks, it will transfer to the next attack.
If you lose the timing and press the button too soon, your respiration will be disordered, and you won't be able to move to the next attack.
Well, let's start.

+Break the iron wall's defense!+
(break his defense by attacking quickly and rhythmically but not mashing)

(if you succeed)
Soldier:
Time's over! That's it! Whoo, You do pretty well. You penetrated my defense which I thought was an iron wall.
I will have to polish my defense more!

(if you did really well)
Soldier:
I give up! Stop it already!
You completely broke through my defense...
To have a person like you exist, the world must be quite wide...

(walk outside the town)

Woman:
That looks like the monster that the soldier mentioned.

[Will you take the tutorial?]
1) Yes (*)
2) No

[Tutorial will begin. First, approach the monster.
+Battle System Feature+
Outside buildings and inside dungeons, monsters loiter around. The screen and controls do not change -- in this state, battle will commence.
When you come close to monsters, they will attack, but the player may initiate an attack before them.
Approach the monster closer.
When you get close to monsters and enemies, a red marker will display.
When you press CIRCLE while the red marker is displaying, the hero will begin to attack that target. From then, he will continue attacking the target automatically.
Furthermore, when the attack target is decided, a target-lock will display in it's HP meter, and a yellow ring will display on the hero's head.
It will indicate again who you are attacking.
Also while attacking, if you perform other actions such as moving, your attacking will be cancelled, so beware.]

(attacking the monster)
[Once you perform an attack, you cannot make your next action until the wait time runs out.
At the status on the bottom of the screen, ATW Gauge is displayed in yellow. This bar is the remaining wait time.
For only the hero, moving is possible while ATW Gauge time remains. However, when you move, your automatic attack will be cancelled.
When you suffer attacks, you will receive wait time. When you are surrounded by a mass, you will not be able to move, so beware.
Pressing TRIANGLE, you may select "defend" from the command menu, so you can defend from your position.
While defending, the damage received from enemies will be reduced, but you cannot receive the defend effect during wait time.
When the target's HP becomes 0, it will be destroyed.  Each target's HP is displayed in a bar above their heads.
When your or your comrades' HP becomes 0, they will be on the verge of death and will not be able to act. When all members become in this state, it is Game Over. Please have caution.]

(killing monster)
+Obtained Dream Key!+
[Dream Key: A mysterious key that can open doors that link dream sceneries to dream sceneries.]

(talking to the soldier on the right side outside the inn)
Soldier:
Oh, it looks like you've gained some experience.
You look strong, but physical strength alone won't let you be the top grade.
I will test you in how much you are versed in battle.
Will you try to challenge it?

Merklich:
1) Yes (*)
2) No

(The order of the multiple choice answers are listed randomly each game.)

Soldier:
Well then, here are the questions!
When you don't have enough STR required  to equip a weapon, what penalty will you get?

Merklich:
1) MOV will decrease
2) Maximum HP will lower
3) ATW will increase (*)

Soldier:
When you change the magic level of the spell you are chanting, what are you changing?

3) Equipping (*)

Soldier:
During wait time, there is an ability that only you have. What is that?

Merklich:
1) Defend command
2) Protect friend
3) Move with left analog stick (*)

Soldier:
Having all questions correct, you're top-grade not only from outward appearance but inside! You can become genuinely first class!

(search behind barrels for Pearl Bead)

(talk to blond kid)
Where is it...

(talk to small kid)
Hmm, where could it be?

(check blue door at right of town)
The door is locked. It looks like it wil open if you use Dream Key.
Do you want to know how to use Important Items?

1) Yes (*)
2) No

[While proceeding on adventure, there are items you can obtained called Important Items.
In order to use them, choose Item -> Important Item from the Command Menu and select the item.
However, there are cases that it cannot be used if you are too far from the object, so beware.

(use Dream Key 「夢見のカギ」　on blue door and go inside)

(talk to old man at right)
Man:
A long time ago, I was called the Swift Heavenly Warrior.
When I ran, it was a gale. There was no other who could outdistance me...
Even so, I had a secret.
That secret was that I ate a magic apple everyday.
Of course, finding apples everyday was hard. So I hid an apple on top of a pillar in a village.
Just hiding them wouldn't be interesting. So I prepared a device.
On top of the pillars other than the correct one, I set a bunch of garbage. So if you are careless, you'll be covered in trash.
I wonder if you can find one magic apple?
Speaking of which, the children in the village search for treasure everyday.
I wonder if they have been able to find the magic apple?
I wonder how many pillars you will have to shake to find the apple?

(talk to man behind counter)
Man:
How troubling... That customer sitting over there, he can't move because his lower back hurts.
I want to go buy painkillers for him, but I cannot part from here.

(talk to sitting man)
Man:
Oh, you! I'm sorry but can I ask you to buy something for me?
I hit my hip a while ago and I can't move properly. I can't move from this position.
I heard that the shop just outside the exit in front of the counter sells medicine effective for hip pain, but I can't move.
Will you go for me?

Merklich
1) Yes (*)
2) No

Man:
Thank you!
Well, please buy with this.

+Obtained 15 mil!+

Man:
I'm counting on you!

(go outside to village where you came from)

(check a pillar to find the apple)
[Will you shake this pillar?]
1) Yes (*)
2) No

[Garbage from above fell on your head]

(hitting the correct pillar; it's random)
[Something fell from above.]
+Obtained Gale Apple!+

(talk to small kid)
So you have to do that, huh.

(talk to blond kid)
I knew it was over there. But, that was the way to make it fall?

(talk to old man by bench)
Old Man:
Hmm, having a walk is so pleasant, but I walked too much...
I already reached my body's limits, so I can't return back home.
I have painkillers but that won't give my strength back.
I wonder if anyone have recovery medicine?

[Will you give him recovery medicine?]
1) Yes (*)
2) No

Old man:
Oh, you'll give this to me? I'm grateful.
Well then, I only have this as thanks. Please take it.

+Obtained Painkiller!+

Old man:
It looks like I can go home with this. Thank you, young one.

(go inside inn and talk to innkeeper)
Innkeeper:
Ahh, you've found the treasure! That's too bad for the children, but this is dangerous and can't be played with.
Say, I'll discuss it but, won't you give me that treasure?
They couldn''t find it themselves, but to commemorate the children's treasure finding, I want to give it to them as a present.
I'm not saying for free. Will you exchange it for a toolbox?

Merklich:
1) Yes (*)
2) No

Innkeeper:
It's a deal.
Thank you, sir.

+Obtained Toolbox!+

(go inside blue door and give medicine to sitting man)
Man:
Ohh! You bought it for me! Well, please give it to me! (Select 鎮痛薬)

Man:
Thank you very much!
Huu. That's much better. It doesn't look like I can move again, but I'll thank you!
(talk again)
Man:
Is there another business?

Merklich:
1) Return the unused money (*)
2) It's nothing

Man:
Eh, you received the medicine? I see, so you came to return the money.
Well, as thanks I'll give it to you. You really helped me, so please accept it.

(talk to old man at right)
Old man:
You found the treasure on to of the pillar?
It's good that you found it but you're covered in garbage.
If you looked and listened around the area more, you could use your reasoning skills.

(exit south)
Man coming out of elevator:
Hmm, somehow the condition of the elevator is bad. I'd better tell a technician.
(talk to him)
Man:
There are monsters outside, so be careful.
Also, when I rode the elevator, I heard a strange noise.
I have to patrol this place. If you have time, will you tell someone?
Below the elevator's entrance, there is a shop right next to it. There is a technician there.
Will you tell him that the elevator's condition is strange?

(go into elevator)
[Will you descend in the elevator?]
1) Yes (*)
2) No

(talk to armor shop clerk)
Clerk:
Welcome.

[Will you inform him about the strange noise from the elevator?]
1) Yes (*)
2) No

Clerk:
What!
Damn! I opened the door too strongly!
I knew it. The door's hinges broke. Haa~
Please wait a bit. I will come look at the elevator.
Looks like the gears won't run together well.
I don't have tools on hand, so I've only made emergency measure, but I think it will be fine for a while.
It would be better to make real repairs, but as I said before, I don't have tools.
I lent them out and they still haven't returned.
The door is also broken. Ohoho...
Anyway, thank you for telling me.

(give him toolbox 「工具箱」)

Clerk:
This is!
I'm saved! With this I can repair the elevator and the door!
This is really small, but it's my thanks. Please take it.

+Obtained 5 mil!+

Clerk:
All right! I'm going to start fixing!

(go outside city west)

Woman:
There!
A swarm of gels close to such a town!

Soldier:
Hey! You over there!

Woman:
It looks like they are calling you.

Soldier:
We are going to clean up these monsters now! If you can, please help!

Woman:
Direct attacks are generally not effective to Gel type monsters. Please be careful.

[Will you like explanation on Magic and Item Use?]
1) Yes (*)
2) No

[For magic, select Magic 「魔法」 from the menu with the character you want to cast magic. Next, select the Magic Lv.
When the chanting ends, you can choose a target and use magic.
For HP, you can heal with goods as well as recovery magic.
When you use an item, its effect is immediate, but you can only hold 9 of each kind of item.
Different from items, magic costs chanting time, and when used it will consume MP. Use them according the the situation.]

Soldier:
Radar points and HP bars indicated in green are characters that you should protect.
They are called NPC (non player character).
When NPC's in the field are killed by monsters, it will become Game Over if many are killed. Be careful.
Especially for NPC's that are villagers who cannot fight, you should be proactive in protecting them from monsters and enemies For units who have lost HP, their mark on the radar will begin blinking. Watch the radar closely and caution.

(use fire arrow to kill the gels)
(after all gels killed)

Soldier:
Wow, thanks for helping us!
If it's all right, please use this.

+Obtained Ambrosia!+

Soldier:
It costs MP to exterminate gels. With this you can recover it.
Recently it has been insecure here so you may get involved in battles at any time.
It is good to recover and be prepared while you can.
Thank you very much for helping us kill the monsters.

(go inside city and talk to girl standing by sparkling trees)
Girl:
In order to make a better environment to live in on this continent, we have to have many of these trees behind me.
In order to make a better continent, everyone please help in fund-raising.
(talk again)
I don't mind the amount. But, if I had 20 mil more I'd be good!
Please donate!

Merklich:
1) Donate (*)
2) Ignore

Merklich:
1) 5 mil
2) 10 mil
3) 15 mil

5) Quit

(knock on brown door in lower right)
Researcher:
Hm? Do you have business with me?
I'm putting test results in order so I'm busy now...

Well, we've arrived.
The test is very simple. First, memorize the status of this room.
Once you remembered it, tell me. Then I will move only one thing. Tell what that is.
Well then, memorize it.

[Map checking mode with right analog stick:
To check the status of the map, map checking mode is convenient. To end map chedking, press CIRCLE or X.
When in map checking mode, times does not flow, so you can deliberately check the current status.]

(talk to researcher)
Researcher:
Are you prepared?

Merklich:
1) Yes (*)
2) No

Researcher:
Well then, here I go! Switch on!
Now there should be a change somewhere! Check the location that you think has changed.
You get one chance. Investigate carefully.

(check the correct item)

Researcher:
Splendid! You have very good memory!
You'll probably be very good at skills such as memorizing magic.
Thank you for taking part in my test!
Well then, let's go outside.
It was bad of me to make you a test subject. This is thanks.

+Obtained Pearl Bead!+

Researcher:
Well then, excuse me.

(talk to kids to left of the sparkling trees)
Big kid:
What is it, big brother? You have business with us?

Kid 1:
You have business with us!

Kid 2:

Kid 3:

Big kid:
Agh! You guys are loud! Be quiet a bit!
The game is to remember these three children's names. You just have to get them right; it's simple.
Well, tell your names in turn!

(names will be random and you may not be able to follow the script here)

Kid 1:
I'm Joney!

Kid 2:
Play!
I'm Kate!

Kid 3:
..., Ray?

Big kid:
No! That's my name!
Your name is Jon!

Kid 3:
..., Is it?

Big kid:
Yes! You should at least memorize your own name!
Well, we've introduced names, so everyone line up over there!
Now then, let's shuffle!

Play!

Big kid:
I'm confident in running! Let's have a match in racing!

Merklich:
1) Yes (*)
2) No

Big Kid:
All right brother! Well, here is the explanation!
They are standing in three places as checkpoints. You have to run around them and come back here.
They will tell you whether you passed the checkpoints where they are standing.
Any order is fine, so whoever runs around them all and returns first wins!
Well then, here's the match!

(run around the children and back)

Big Kid:
You're fast...
This is the first time I lost in a race!
Well, thank you big brother! We're satisfied!

Kids:
Thank you!

Big kid:
If you have the chance, play with us again!

(talk to couple by bench)

Woman:
There is a thicket planted facing the ocean.
Lately, in that area bees make nests and it would be trouble to check them if you're not careful.

Man:
But the children aren't careful of the bee's nests.
I saw them hide something in the thicket a while ago.
I want them not to play when it's dangerous though.

Man in gray suit:
Do you have business with me?
A bird flew away from this city holding a faintly shining object.

Man walking around:
.....
... It's not here.
It's not here! It's not here! It's not heere!
What should I do? I didn't expect the string of the necklace would break.
I worked hard to get it, but now I'm in the red.
Where could they have fallen...  I inspected the city, before that I reserved at the inn,
...it's possible it dropped outside the city too.
(talk again)
Excuse me! Have any pearls dropped around here?
If you find any, please give them to me!

(give Pearl Beads)

Man:
With this I can return the necklace to normal. Thank you very much!
Ah, I'm so relieved.
I would have collided with the running children again if I kept searching around frantically.
Ah, I'm truly saved.

Hidden man at right of the city:
You've found me, huh.
What? It was obvious by looking at the radar!?
...I see. It looks like you're confident in knowledge. If so, I will test you!

Merklich:
1) Yes (*)
2) No

Hidden man:
You'll take the challenge? Fine, I will test you!
What color are your party members displayed on the radar?

Wow, no way, you got all questions correct! I lose...

(go back to village and go in middle door at right)

[The final test, is written on the plate]

Woman:
...Ahead of here is the end of the dream. Will you open the door now?

1) Yes (*)
2) No

Woman:
If you proceed ahead in there, you cannot return here. Is that fine?

1) Yes (*)
2) No

Woman:
This seems to be the same place, but the conditions are strange somehow.
It's trouble! Monsters have come and put the village in peril!
If this keeps up the villagers will...
Ordinary people cannot help against the monsters.
Is there a way to lure the monsters and ensure the safety of the people?

[Before you are noticed by monsters, by pressing X you will signal villagers to escape to the exit.
By signaling, the monsters will notice you and start sttacking, so be careful of the timing.]

Woman:
It looks like the scrap wood can catch fire.
By using magic, you can make the flames larger, and the monsters will probably be distracted.

(use fire arrow on fires. Use recovery medicine on the injured soldier and he will join the fight.)

Woman:
It looks like your dream world goes up to here. You have generally shown me your character.
It seems you hold high elementary attainments as a warrior.

(stat screen)

Woman:
You have fulfilled many areas in what I am looking for. When the time comes I will probably need you to lend me your hand.
However, it's not that time yet...
I will probably meet you someday. I will look forward to it.
Then, until that time...

Voice 2:
Correct.

Voice 1:
The operation must be a success, right?

At any rate, these will influence the future of our company Monopolis.
I'll sincerely entrust to you that there will be no problems.

1) "Merklich" (*)
2) ......

Doctor:
It looks like you remember your name.
Anything other than that?

Merklich:
1) Can't remember
2) Say nonsensical things
3) I'll try to remember (*)

[When you try to remember hard, your head hurts intensely.]

Doctor:
Hey, don't overdo it!
The inspection shows there is nothing unusual about your head. Your memories are probably disordered temporarily, so you should relax.
Tonight, someone is coming to meet you, so until then you have free time inside the facility.
This is your identification proof. When you affirm that it is yours, you can leave the room.

+Obtained Monopolis Identification!+

Doctor:
Take care.

(check girl lying on bed)

[A girl about the same age is sleeping.]

Doctor:
...An acquaintance? She opened her eyes once, but fell asleep again.

(talk to doctor. you may choose all choices)

Merklich:
1) Where is this place?
2) Who am I?
3) Why don't I have any memories?

1)
Doctor:
This is Lennox research laboratory. It belongs to Monopolis.

2)
Doctor:
If you look at the ID card I gave you, you'll know.

3)
...It seems to be from an accident, but I don't know the details...

(look at the ID in inventory, Important Items, モノポリス社社員証)

		Merklich]
It is unmistakeably your own identification.

Monopolis Soldier outside:
Hey, it's been a while. The mark on your cheek didn't disappear from the operation.
Well, that is fine. Now, the other guards are preparing to march, so they are worked up. Be careful.

(go near group)

Monopolis Guard Captain:
There has been report that a terrorist hideout has been discovered close by.
From here we will annihilate it! First, we will form the group's strategy.

(talk to captain)

Monopolis Guard Captain:
Have you recovered? Stay here on standby today!

(go inside building above the group, talk to researcher)

Researcher:
This reactor is very strong, so with this size it provides energy to not only this laboratory, but the nearby facility.
Because of that, maintenance is a lot of work.
Oh, don't touch it carelessly. If it explodes, it would blow away the mountain outside.

(talk to soldier by door in top right)

Monopolis Guard Soldier:
Hey, you've woken up? It's good that you didn't end up dying.

Monopolis Guard Captain:
Hey, it's time to gather.

Monopolis Guard Soldier:
Yes!
Hey, I have a request. The key on this door is broken. Make sure no suspicious person enters it.
Well, in the first place make sure no suspicious person enters the laboratory.
I'm counting on you!

(enter the room, talk to prisoner)

Girl:
Ah, it's been a while! You've finally awoken!
It's prompt, but please tell me about the great wound on your chest as promised.

1) Ask her "What is it about a chest wound?"
2) Ask her "Do you know me?" (*)
3) Ignore her

Girl:
Huh? You don't know who I am?
So even I am forgotten to you...
When you returned, you promised to tell me about your chest wound.
I was only looking forward to living to finally learn about you...
The atmosphere about you is somehow different today. It must be because of that matter...
So you've completely forgotten those ten days? No... those memories...

(talk again)
Girl:
I want your memories to return. It doesn't have to be all of them. At least, please remember just those ten days!
If you don't want to tell me about your wound, that's fine. If so, please at least remember me...

+Obtained Pressed Flower Bookmark!+

(leave room)

Girl:
You're leaving already, huh...
The next time you return here, you will probably be an enemy.

1) Ask her why (*)
2) Remain silent

Girl: If you remember, you'll understand everything.
However, please remember just this. If you return here, even as an enemy, I will cooperate with you.
Today, time is stirring... I feel a bad premonition. Be careful.
If something happens to you, I will come to help at that time...

Girl in pink:
Ah, are you possibly the person who is supposed to meet me?
Shuweizer, right?

Merklich:
1) Yes, that's right
2) It's someone else (*)
3) Say nothing

Girl in pink:
Oh, it's someone else? I'm sorry, I was rude.
If there was someone with a tattoo on the face like yours, they were supposed to tell me that feature. It's easy to tell with that.
Well, I wonder where is Shuweizer?
That reminds me, I haven't told you my name. I'm Wendy.
And you are?

Merklich:
1) Name yourself (*)
2) Don't name yourself

Wendy:
Nice to meet you!
I knew you couldn't be Shuweizer.
Speaking of which, Shuweizer is the captain of the Monopolis special force, right?
For an important person like that to come meet me is...

Merklich:
1) It's probably another person with the same name
2) He's probably just incidentally on the way
3) Because Wendy is selected to join the special unit (*)
4) Remain silent

Wendy:
Oh, is that so? It would be good if I can fit in with the special unit...

(leave through door)

Wendy:
Huh? What?

Terrorist:
Hmph! There are still people here...

Terrorist:
What can they do with just two people? We will stop them. You will go destroy the power reactor!

Terrorist:
Understood!

Wendy:
Destroy the reactor? We can't allow them!
There is only you and me here! Let's work together and defeat the terrorists!

Terrorist:
All right, I've set a timed magical device, it's complete!

Terrorist:
Okay, retreat from here before we get caught in the explosion!

Wendy:
If this reactor explodes, this building wil be blown to bits! If we don't do something...!

Terrorist
The success is ours!

Terrorist:
Destroy Monopolis!

(kill a terrorist)
Even if I die, our ideals will not!

(kill a terrorist)
Terrorist:
Even if you kill me, you can't stop that device...

Wendy:
We have to stop that device quickly!
How do I deal with a bomb shaped like this...
No good... I'm not in time...!

(anime scene)
Girl's voice:
Do not give up! You have the power in you!

Shuweizer
Hey, you two people. Come over here.

Wendy:
Y-yes!

Wendy:
Huh? Why am I here? Did I have a strange dream...?
Hey, you are... No, it's nothing.
(Yeah, it's better if I don't say it. I can't even believe it myself...)
I'll introduce myself. I'm Wendy. You are?

1) Name yourself (*)
2) Don't name yourself

Wendy:
Nice to meet you.
...Umm, I don't know what it is, but somehow I feel a bad premonition.
It's like this laboratory will be attacked.
Oh, it's just an example! A hypothetical example!

[From now, Mission Battles will have the ability to Continue. By Game Over or Soft Reset, when you return to the Title Menu, a Continue command is added. When Continue is selected, you may play again from the starting point on the Mission Battle.

(if you walk to the opposite door)
Wendy:
...Say, it's not my memories, my intuition says it was surely from the other way... That's what I sense...

(if you walk to the door the terrorists entered from)
Wendy:
...Yes, if it's not my imagination, then surely it was from this way...

1) Ask her what is she talking about
2) Agree with her (*)
3) Remain silent

Wendy:
...Huh? You too?
...I knew it, they came from this way...

Terrorist:
Hmph, there are still people here.

Terrorist:
What can they do with just two people? We will stop them. You will go destroy the furnace!

Terrorist:
Understood!

Wendy:
We cannot let them!
Let's work together and defeat the terrorists!

Y-you! You're getting in the way!

(kill the terrorists, after battle)

Wendy:
...Ah..  We managed to defend it...

Shuweizer:
Hey, are you all right?

Wendy:
Eh, uh, yes...

Shuweizer:
I took care of the guys outside. The terrorists didn't make it inside?

Wendy:
They came but we dealt with them. There was no damage.

Shuweizer:
I see...
I am Shuweizer of the Red Wolf Unit. I came to meet two people who will work under me.

Wendy:
Red Wolf Unit...!? Then you're truly Sir Shuweizer...

Shuweizer:
At any rate, to prevent an attack with just two people, you've done quite well.
It's like you knew beforehand that such a thing would happen.

Wendy:
Well, about tthat...

Shuweizer:
What is it? Just go ahead and say it.

1) I had a premonition about it
2) I experienced it once (*)
3) I saw it in a dream
4) Remain silent

Shuweizer:
Experienced? Are you saying that seriously?

Wendy:
Uhh, well...

Shuweizer:
(...Well, well. isn't this the best stage...)
I will depart when my business is finished. Make your preparations.

Wendy:
...Ah...I'm dizzy...

Woman:
If we don't do something...
This planet will be headed for the end...
The land will be swallowed in time...
If this keeps up... This world will collapse...
If we don't do something...

[This is Esgrentz continent. In the south is Hingistan Kingdom, where internal discord is occuring from people aiming to release the country from the despotic administration of the royal family.
The anti-government organization disperses before the powerful government troop, and through repeated occurrences of small-scale revolts in various places, Hingistan Kingdom is in disorder.
Fomeros country in the west, unable to let it pass unnoticed, sends soldiers to the struggles in Hingistan. With Hingistan, Fomeros, and the anti-government organization, a three way scheme has formed.
International corporation Monopolis, which is situated in the neighboring country in the east, Jewarl, holds its own soldiers and is expanding its market to the war regions.]

[Two days after the attack on Lennox research facility -- Merklich is assigned security duty in the area of Makinus, a city of Monopolis headquarters.]

Monopolis Guard Captain:
Thank you for the report.

(go toward elevator)

Monopolis Guard Soldier:
Oh, sorry, I got in your way.
You're not in uniform, is it your day off?
At any rate, recently Terrorist movements have been active.
Because of that, it seems that Fomeros and Hingistan have ceased war temporarily in order to exterminate Terrorists.
If both countries put in earnest effort to counter the Terrorists, we as a private enterprise won't have to cross a dangerous borderline.

1) Agree with him
2) I don't think it will go smoothly (*)
3) We will become jobless that way
4) Remain silent

Monopolis Guard Soldier:
Is that so? I was counting on it though...

(descend in elevator)

Monopolis Guard Soldier:
You're a face I haven't seen. Show me your ID.
(select モノポリス社社員証)

Monopolis Guard Soldier:
...I see. I have received report about you. You don't seem to be a suspicious person.
There is a reception on the first floor of the headquarters building, so receive the procedures there.
Or will you come to rest in the employee dorms before that? Employee dorms are to the left of the headquarters building.
If you talk to a clerk inside, they will give you a room.

(approach man in blue)

Man:
Are you perhaps from the security sect?
The Monopolis security sect, I mean the special duty division?
It is called Red Wolf division. They have different orders from the other guard members, and are a very elite group!
When I heard that the Commander's son was the leader, I thought it was just an organization for pomp, but when they displayed how well they exterminated terrorists, I can't object.
It's like they are gifted from heaven.
If you're also a guard member, it would be good if you can become part of the Red Wolf division someday.

Wendy:
It's been a while. You were also summoned?

Shuweizer:
Hey, you two. Come over here.

Wendy:
Y-yes!

Shuweizer:
Enter here. Miss Shayer is waiting.

(enter room)

Shayer:
Is it these two people?

Shuweizer:
Yes.
It seems we let an attack through one time, but with Anita's guidance, we were able to defend.

Shayer:
Anita's guidance, I see. We can take that as a success, right?

Shuweizer:
It would be so.

Wendy:
Umm, what exactly is..

Shayer:
It is sudden, but you two are admitted into the special duty unit under the command of Shuweizer.

Wendy:
Huh, the Red Wolf division!?

Shuweizer:
What, is it disagreeable?

Wendy:
N-no! That's not it! It's that I never even thought in my dreams that I could enter the Red Wolves...

Shuweizer:
...Hm. If that's so then there's no problem.

Shayer:
It's immediate, but I'll have you participate in the operation.
A little northeast from here is a city called Dastis. We've received information that it has become a Terrorist relay base.
Looking at the release point of the information and relation to the actual facts, the credibility of this information is extremely high.
Furthermore the Terrorists still do not know that we know that information.
So with this small specially picked unit, you are to find the Terrorist relay base and destroy it.

Shuweizer:
That means that is our job.
The other members outside of us are already headed to Dastis on a different case. If we moved as a group we would stand out.
As soon as your preparations are complete, go to Dastis. I will also go there ahead of you and wait at the inn.
I'll be taking a room by the name of Rat, so go there first.

Shayer:
Well then, as soon as you have prepared, depart to Dastis.
We cannot allow even the slightest failure on this mission. Make plenty of preliminary investigations.
First, I will give you this.

+Obtained Continent Map!+

Shayer:
So then, I will also grant you permission to the database room below. By all means, make use of it to help you succeed in your missions.

Wendy:
Yes, thank you very much!

(exit the room)

Wendy:
I was aspiring to enter the Red Wolf division! My goal has come true!

1) I'm happy as well
2) I'm not
3) Point out the mistake on how it should be 'my dream has come true' (*)
4) Remain silent

Wendy:
Dream has come... ahh! Yes, that's right!
I won't say it was something like a goal, that would be too ordinary!
Well, there's something I want to check out a bit, so I'll try going to the database room.
Let's meet at the gate of the city. Until then we'll have tree time.
Don't go without me, okay? I haven't been to Dastis before.

(use elevator and go to 8F room)

Wendy:
...Huh, record deleted? What does that mean...?
Even with Red Wolf access priviledges, more than this is...

(talk to clerk)

Clerk
This is the Monopolis database room. Do you need an explanation?

1) Yes (*)
2) No

Inside the showcase in front of us are samples of products that our company developed. Of course, they are items that can be used immediately.
In the furthest lefthand side is a database computer terminal. Access rights are required to use it.

Wendy:
Ah, oh, you also came here? I'm already finished, so let's go shopping or something...

(use Database if you want)
[
1) Region data
	1-1) Continent
		1-1-1) Esgrentz continent
				Continent centered on Fomeros, Hingistan, and Jewarl countries.
				It is center of the activities of Monopolis corporation.
		1-1-2) Sealed continent "Goatland"
				Other names, "scapegoat land" and "closed-off continent". 				There is a barrier around the ocean of the continent. 				There is no current accurate record of how the 				barrier came to be.
				From the legends left in various lands, there was a world-
				scale battle 2000 years ago, a great disaster was 				enclosed in the continent and sealed so that it could not 				leave.
				And therefore from the sacrifices of the people living on that 				continent, we currently have peace.
				From the folklore of "scapegoats", it became called "Goatland" 				since an unknown time.
				In recent years there has been observation of the barrier 				faltering, so there is possibility that it will eventually be 				cleared.
				If there are people living on Goatland, then there will be an 				untapped market there. Not only Monopolis group, 				enterprises around the world will be aiming for 				Goatland's market.
	1-2) Country
		1-2-1) Jewarl
				In the continent's northeast, Jewarl is crossed by a mountain 				range and divides north and south.
				In south Jewarl where Monopolis is, here is Makinus and Dastis. 				In north Jewarl there are metropolises.
		1-2-2) Hingistan
				Nation with monarchical system by Hingistan royal family. Due 				to one part of the authority figures obtaining profits, the 				difference between rich and poor is steep. There is a 				terrorist organization aiming to strike down the Hingistan 				royal family.
				To control the Terrorist movements, Hingistan army pressure 				becomes tight, Terrorists inflict more damage on people, 				and it becomes a vicious circle.
				A few days ago the first prince died in battle. Furthermore, 				the second prince has gone missing since a few years ago.
		1-2-3) Fomeros
				To suppress the conflict in Hingistan, Fomeros participates in 				war with Hingistan in the name of protecting the 				citizens.
				Currently their objective is to release the citizens from the 				despotism of the Hingistan royal family, and war between 				them continues.
				One theory is that Fomeros is aiming after the mines in 	
				Hingistan, and certainly looking at the Fomeros army 				formations, one may assert so.
	1-3) City
		1-3-1) Makinus
				Port city in south Jewarl. It is mostly consisted of Monopolis 				connections, and under the guard of Monopolis troops, it 				is managed by its own order.
				It is an important source of finances for Jewarl country, and 				the country does not proactively intervene.
				Also, it is model city of Monopolis' new technology, and is 				the most unpolluted city in the world.
		1-3-2) Dastis
				City situated northeast of Makinus in Jewarl country. Although 				within the country they are on equal scale, because they 				do not bring in technology from Monopolis, the soil suffers 		
				contamination from pollution.
		1-3-3) El Hingis
				Capital of Hingistan Kingdom, due to its position in the 	
				continent's furthest south it is difficult for other 				countries to attack	it. Land of abundant ocean resources, 				it also exports unique fruits and vegetation from the 				subtropics climate.
		1-3-4) Leystan
				Hingistan's north city. Developed commerce with Fomeros and 				Jewarl. When attacked by other countries it 				geographically serves as a defense position, but from 				result of successive damage by Terrorists, currently 				Fomeros army has occupied it. Terrorist damage continues 				after that and Fomeros army is suffering the real damage.
		1-3-5) Schizarz
				Fishing village at furthest east Hingistan. It is not a big 				city, but it is allies with Monopolis, and there is a mutual 				relation. There are periodic boats traveling between us.
		1-3-6) Royferon
				City at country's east border of Fomeros. It is window of 				trade with Hingistan. However, due to war status with 				Hingistan, insufficiency of goods seems to be becoming a 				serious problem.
2) Personnel data
	2-1) Merklich
		Employee Number - TMR003
		Data absent
	2-2) Wendy
		Employee Number - MWR645
		Entered company April last year
		Produces excellent results from research time, holds high hopes for 		future.
		Has acquired "Heat Haze Spearmastery".
	2-3) Shuweizer
		Employee Number - STMR002
		First son of current Monopolis commander.
		Responsible for special sect Red Wolf unit.
	2-4) Shayer
		In charge of training Shuweizer until a few years ago.
		Her merit is highly regarded, she is sole company manager.
	2-5) Maxwell
		Employee Number - MM413
		Record deleted.
3) Other data
	3-1) Red Wolf unit
		Alias of a special sect of guard troops. The special unit does not 		perform ordinary policing, its main duty is to proactively 		remove things that are disadvantageous to the corporation.
		One sect performs actual work, the second obtains information so 		that the first can perform actions. Also, members of the special 		sect do not wear uniforms but were their own attire.
	3-2) Market expansion plan
		Due to current markets having no hope of further expansion, we are 		looking for a new market in a new continent. The barrier on the sealed 		continent Goatland has been weakening in recent years and it is 		predicted to break soon.
	3-3) Soil pollution purification plan
		From Pollumine, a magical plant that we developed, soil pollution 		from factory waste can be purified. Pollumine absorbs contamination 		matter from the soil and stores it inside its fruits. Due to 		that, the fruits are harmful. The collected fruits are 		safely disposed of in our processing facilities. Because 		Pollumine seeds are expensive, there are many cities that do 		not introduce it.

Armorer:
If you are going out, you have to prepare your equipment!
This store purveys for the headquarters!

(talk to him if you want)
Armorer:
Welcome. This is the weapon and armor store.
We are now dealing with equipment for beginners!
To obtain ability plates that let you use magic and skills, you must use new equipment!
Will you be buying or selling?

Merklich:
1) Buy weapons
2) Buy armor
3) Sell
4) Equipment and Plates explanation (*)

[Will you have explanation on equipment and plates?
1) Receive explanation (*)
2) Do not receive explanation

[There are two types of equipment; weapon and armor.
Weapons mainly raise ATK and increase damage done to enemies.
Armor mainly raises DEF, and reduces damage received from enemies.
By getting accustomed to using weapons and armor, characters will generate ability plates necessary for growth.
The generated Ability Plates will give the player various abilities.
Weapons and armor will generate ability plates up to three strongest kinds. This menu which is displayed at time of equipping will show the ability plates of candicacy
The order 1-3 is the priority order of the generated ability plates. This order can be decided at the time of equipping.
The ability plate will be created when the "mastery level meter" becomes full.
Generated ability plates are stocked in each character, but only one of each kind is created.
Ability plates that are already generated will not be created so beware.]

(exit city

Wendy:
I made you wait. Well, shall we depart for Dastis?
I looked it up a while ago, so coming out of here it looks like we should head northeast.

[Wendy has joined your party!]

Wendy:
Well, let's finally be off to Dastis!
By the way, have you completely prepared for travel?

1) Yes (*)
2) No

Wendy:
Hoho, well done, well done!
Then, you did a check?
Recovery medicine...
Four of them? If we have this many, we should be fine!
Then, I'll give you the recovery medicines that I bought too!
......Huh?
It's not here!? I don't have it!
I must have dropped it somewhere!

1) Look at her indifferently
2) Console her (*)
3) Be shocked

Wendy:
Sigh...

1) Continue to fuss about it
2) Let it go (*)

Wendy:
......
The truth is, I bought recovery medicine, but I used it all...
Ahh! Don't look at me like that!

(walk outside)

Wendy:
Pollumine is a mysterious type of tree. It has both gentle and eerie colors. But thanks to Monopolis developing this magical plant, this area's soil pollution can be purified.

(check circle on the ground)

Wendy:
This is a Transgate made by Pothrads.
A long time ago it seems this was used to instantly move from various towns but after the Pothrads were gone, it can't be used any more.
If we could use it, it would be convenient. That's too bad.

(go northeast)

Wendy:
I don't know how many times we'll have to fight until we reach Dastis, but if you don't want to fight, then tell me!

[About Escape
When you want to make a battle end, by holding down R2 you will be able to take the Escape action. If you let go of R2, then you will return to normal actions. It is convenient to flee from enemies, so remember it.]

Wendy:
Well then, let's go!

(go northeast)

Wendy:
In this area, the trees are dried up. Industrial waste from Dastis pollutes the water severely.

1) Ask about effects of Pollumine (*)
2) Say nothing

Wendy:
When I looked it up at the database, Dastis seems to dislike Monopolis company so they do not purchase Pollumine.
It's not cheap, but if the earth dies out, we can't live...

(go northeast, walk a bit)

Wendy:
Dastis is coming into view!
Say, did you research about Dastis?

1) Yes (*)
2) No

Wendy:
Oh, very good! As the Red Wolf unit's first mission, we can't fail!
Since we've finally entered the Red Wolves, we have to excel in our duties!

1) You shouldn't say the name of the unit out loud (*)
2) Say nothing.

Wendy:
Ah, wah, that's right!
No one heard me, right?
By the way, it's Dastis, but from what I investigated...

[Dastis
City situated northeast of Makinus in Jewarl country. Although within the country they are on equal scale, because they do not bring in technology from Monopolis, the soil suffers contamination from pollution.]

Wendy:
That was it.
Well, let's do our best in working as Red Wolves!

(go northeast to enter Dastis)

Wendy:
We've arrived. Shuweizer is supposed to be waiting at the inn.
Hey, do you remember the name he took to book the inn?

1) Cat
2) Rat (*)
3) Bat
4) Don't remember

Wendy:
Yes, it was that. Well, shall we go?

(walk by)

Storekeeper:
We have received a new supply of enchant gems! Please have a look!

[Gem synthesis has become available on the setting menu.]

(enter inn and talk to innkeeper)

Innkeeper:
Welcome. How may I help you?

Merklich:
1) Stay the night
2) Save
3) Go to Rat's room (*)

Innkeeper:
You are with Rat? Please wait a bit.

Wendy:
I like to cook.

1) Surprised by the abrupt change in topic (*)
2) Liking it and being skilled are different
3) Because you like it, you will become better
4) You are crazy about it but you must be bad at it

Wendy:
Isn't it okay?

1) Ignore her
2) Liking it and being skilled are different
3) Because you like it, you will become better (*)
4) You are crazy about it but you must be bad at it

Wendy:
In short, I'll get better from here.
Certainly I think I'm not skilled now, but I really want to become good. If I don't do it I won't improve.

Innkeeper:
I kept you waiting. I will guide you to your room.

Shuweizer:
You're here, huh? You're unexpectedly early.
However, the real duty is from here.

Wendy:
Yes, acknowledged.

Shuweizer:
Then, I will tell you of the task.
As explained before, this city has become the Terrorists' relay base.
Our mission is to find out the location of the base and destroy the Terrorists.
Currently, other people are searching around the city's surroundings. You are to gather information inside the town.

Wendy:
Yes sir!

Shuweizer:
If you find out anything, come to report. Well, I have to go to other subordinates but you can come here for the same procedures like now.

Wendy:
Yes, understood!

(go outside and check rightmost door)

[The door says "Dark Cat". Will you knock?]
1) Yes (*)
2) No

Voice:
Please show me your identification.

Wendy:
Huh? (What should we do?)

Voice:
This store is for members. You must have a membership ID.

(walk west)

Man:
Eugh!

Woman:
You good-for-nothing! You spent all your earnings on drinking, just what were you thinking!

Man:
S-sorry, mother! I won't drink any more at all!

Woman:
I don't believe you!

Man:
It's true!

Woman:
If that's so, then hand over that membership ID you have!

Man:
What! But, that's...

Woman:
You're not going to drink any more, so you don't need it, right? Well, hand it over!

Man:
Uggh...

Woman:
I'm going to throw it away, so you go to work! Hurry it up!

Man:
Yees...
(Knowing her, she would throw it in the dump. If I could get out of work I could go pick it up...)

(go to dump area in the west and pick up shiny item)

+Obtained Dark Cat Membership ID!+

Wendy:
Ah, this is the membership for that bar!

(knock on rightmost door again)

Voice:
Please show me proof of membership.

(select ダークキャット会員証)

Wendy:
Here it is.

Voice:
Confirmed.
Then, password please.

Wendy:
Huh? Password?

Voice:
Today is a special day, so ordinary members cannot enter. Please understand.

Wendy:
...What should we do...

(go inside a building and come back out, go to dump area)

Man:
Huh? What? It should be thrown away around here like always... That is strange...

(talk to him)

Man:
Don't bother me. I'm in the middle of looking for something. Can't you talk to me later?

(use Dark Cat Membership)

Man:
Ohh, that's my membership ID! Give it back to me!

Wendy:
We'll give it to you, but do you know the password?

Man:
Password? Probably the one for special members?

Wendy:
Yes. Do you know it?

Man:
I've never used it before, but on special member days, all of the prices are ten times.
Well, it must be high grade alcohol, but I can't afford it with my meager earnings.

Wendy:
Then, if you tell us the password, we'll give this back to you.

Man:
Well, fine. But if I tell you then you'll have to be prepared to pay ten times the price.
I believe it was "cat brothers will gather tonight".

Wendy:
Thank you!

Man:
Hey! Didn't you say you'd give it back right now?!
Give it to me now!

(go inside bar)

Wendy:
Wait! I only want you to tell me that person's name!

Man:
Do you think you can believe it?

Wendy:
I'll believe it! That person is perhaps...

Soldier 1:
Who the hell are you?

Soldier 2:
These two are Monopolis dogs!

Man:
What! Your partner has come to get in my way?

Wendy:
No, that's wrong! I...

Soldier:
Die!

Soldier:
You can't go further!

Wendy:
Then, I can't hear more about the story in this state!

(after battle)

Wendy:
...I'm sorry...I...

1) Ask for a reason
2) We should first concentrate on chasing after them (*)
3) Remain silent and go after those who have escaped

Wendy:
Y-yes.
I'm sorry about that.

(go to inn to Rat's room.)

Monopolis Soldier:
Sir Shuweizer is out patrolling. I will listen to your report.

(talk to him)

Monopolis Soldier:
...What?
The terrorist leader went through the inner door of the bar?
Understood. I will inform Sir Shuweizer when he returns.
Until then, go investigate the bar's basement. We'll be in trouble if they fled us.

(go to bar's inner door. make your way through sewers)

Terrorist:
Flee from here when you finish putting the load in order. We will hold back the pursuers and buy you time!

Wendy:
If we don't hurry, they'll get away!

Shuweizer:
You will explain thoroughly later. Right now, concentrate on fighting!

Terrorist:
I'm sorry, comrades! I will go ahead!

Terrorist:
You've already gotten this far?
However, I can't let my comrade in danger!
Burn all of the materials here!

Shuweizer:
Tch!

(after battle, talk to Shuweizer)

Shuweizer:
What a bother...
So then, shall I have you explain how things got this way?

Wendy:
It was... because of me.

Shuweizer:
What do you mean?

Wendy:
I... umm... I rushed and acted on my own...
I am very sorry!

Shuweizer:
It was good that I came in time, but if they got away, we would have lost everything.

Wendy:
Yes, I am sorry. There is no excuse.

Shuweizer:
What's already been done cannot be helped. I will let it pass this time.
However, there won't be next time!
If you understand, search this place!

Wendy:
Yes sir!

(search around for document)

+Obtained Terrorists' Memo!+
[Library 4-2-B-133 is written]

Shuweizer:
What's the matter? Did you find something?

(show Terrorist's Memo to Shuweizer, テロリストのメモ)

Shuweizer:
Hm, what is it?
Library 4-2-B-133. Probably their password.
All right, I will give you a chance to redeem yourselves.
The two of you solve this code.
As soon as I finish instructions here, I will wait at the inn's room.

Wendy:
I'm sorry, because of me...

(go to back to town and to library in top right)

Wendy:
First of all, according to the memo it leads us here, but...
Do you know what "Library 4-2-B-133" is?

1) I know (*)
2) I don't know

Wendy:
Well then, let's go!

(use elevator to 4F. check bookshelf 2-B. it's the one in middle of room)

[There is a bookshelf with a "2-B" label. It looks like books are grouped in 50]
1) Upper shelf (101-150) (*)
2) Middle shelf (51-100)
3) Lower shelf (1-50)

[There is no book 133]

Wendy:
Huh? The book is not here?
No! Then, that password is...

Young man:
Excuse me, I want to return a book there...

Wendy:
Ah, sorry.

(man puts back book)

Wendy:
Oh, this is book 133!
Let's hurry and look at it!

(go to Wendy)

Wendy:
The title of the book is "Today's Dinner"? It's a cookbook.
Let's read it. But looking at the whole thing will take time...

1) Page 42 looks suspicious
2) Page 133 looks suspicious
3) Check out all of the pages (*)
4) It has got nothing to do with this book

Wendy:
I knew that's the only thing we could do.
It's no good. It's really only about cooking in here.
How odd, I thought this book would be the one...
It can't be helped. Let's try reading over from the beginning again.
I will investigate this book, so you check another book!

(check upper shelf again on 2-B)

[There is no book on 133's spot. Further inside an item like a paper appears.]

1) Take the paper (*)
2) Do nothing

+Obtained Terrorist Battle Plan!+

(show to Wendy, テロリスト作戦書)

Wendy:
Huh, what's that paper?
It was where book 133 goes?
No way, it was there before?
...At any rate, let's try reading it...

[Binding the agreement with Hingistan and Fomeros, with a ceasefire, both armies' point of attack will easily be turned to us.
However way guerilla attacks are used, if both armies are developed jointly into roller strategy, we cannot win.
Then, we will make both armies collide, interrupt the peace, and finally we will proceed the plan to greatly reduce both countries' military force.
On the day of peace conference of Hingistan and Fomeros, immediately before the conference begins we will impersonate the army and at the same time attack.
After the attack, we will retreat while occupying both armies. Finally we will make both armies collide. At the same time they have successfully collided, the intelligence party will throw the command system into disorder and give false information.
If this plan is a success, until the situation is put under control, it is possible there will be many casualties.]

Wendy:
This is...!?
It's serious! We have to report to Shuweizer immediately!

(go to Shuweizer's inn room)

Monopolis Soldier:
You are late.
The captain has returned to headquarters ahead to report.
If you have a report, then go to him directly.
I'm only remaining here to deal with final matters.

(go back to Makinus, Monopolis headquarters elevator)

Shuweizer:
You've come back?
I was suddenly summoned and had to return.
So then, did you solve the code?

(select テロリスト作戦書)

Shuweizer:
What?
The terrorists are going to carry out this sort of plan?
Hey, you two, come with me.

(go to room on 10F)

Shuweizer:
Go in.

(inside)

Shuweizer:
Shayer!

Shayer:
What is the matter, Sir Shuweizer?

Shuweizer:
I have some news. Come inside.
You two wait here.

Wendy:
Yes sir!
I wonder if we found something really good?
Interfering with the end of the Fomeros and Hingistan war... That's serious.
What do you think?

1) Agree (*)
2) Don't agree
3) Remain silent

Wendy:
That is so, isn't it.

(Shuweizer enters)

Wendy:
Ah, Sir Shuweizer.

Shuweizer:
I will explain the strategy. There is no time, so listen silently.
The terrorists plan to perform their strategy at Schizland plateau. Taking advantage of the fog, two teams of three people wearing uniforms of both armies will come from the west and attack the guards at north and south.
If we're not noticed by either guards and deal with the terrorists disguised as soldiers, the plan will be a success.
If we fail, at the same time of the information operation, the two armies which will have contact severed from the headquarters will continue to fight while in disorder, and it will become a battle with a dreadful number of casualties.
If it comes to that then Fomeros and Hingistan will have alreayd lost, and the terrorists will win.
We absolutely cannot let Hingistan be destroyed. Furthermore, if we are seen, problems will arise. Do not let yourselves be seen.

Wendy:
Sir Shuweizer?
What is he in a hurry for?

1) From the start, this is an urgent issue
2) Confirm the battle plan with her (*)
3) Remain silent

Wendy:
Okay.
Umm, slipping into the fog at Schizland plateau, attack the guards from the west...
Stay undiscovered by both armies, and defeat the disguised terrorists..?

Shayer:
We kept you waiting. Currently the only special units that can act are you, so we will march out with three people.

Shuweizer:
So the question is, can we stop them with just three people.

Wendy:
Therefore, before the terrorists appearing from the west attack the guards from both armies, we will take them out at Schizland, right?

Shuweizer:
...What?

Wendy:
...Just a while ago, that's what Sir Shuweizer said, isn't it?
The terrorists will hide in the fog and do a surprise attack, so before we will discover them and deal with them.

Shayer:
...Yes, that was it.
To clarify for me, will you explain the battle plan again?

1) Explain it yourself (*)
2) Make Wendy explain 
Shayer:
Hmm.
To get to Schizland, you will need a high-speed boat.
There should be one in the docks. I'll give you permission to use it.

Shuweizer:
All right, I will prepare the high-speed boat. Once you have finished your preparations, come to the port.

Wendy:
Yes!

(go outside to docks and find Shuweizer)

Shuweizer:
We will depart with this boat. We cannot make any mistakes.
Further in is a boat that sends materials to Yarstill prison.

(board the speed boat)

Shuweizer:
All right, there is no time to lose. We will move to Hingistan swiftly.

(arrive in Schizland)

Wendy:
This place is...

Shuweizer:
Fishing village Schizarz at the far east of Hingistan. Schizland plateau is just west of here.
We will depart for there after we get a little information. We'll meet outside the village.
I will head there after I give directions to the boat's crew.

Wendy:
Yes, understood!
Schizarz village, huh? It's already been a year since then, hasn't it...

1) Ask what happened here (*)
2) Remain silent

Wendy:
It's a little...
Well, There's someone I know here, so is it all right to visit?

(knock on right-most door)

Woman:
Yes, who is it?

Wendy:
It has been a while. I became in your debt that time.

Woman:
Ah, you are...

Wendy:
I'm sorry for not contacting in even half a year.
...This is little, but...

+Wendy handed over a money pouch+

Woman:
Ahh, I am sorry. To accept this much...

Wendy:
Well, I have work to do, so I will excuse myself.

Woman:
No, please excuse me. Well, take care of yourself.

Wendy:
Well, shall we go?

1) Express interest in what she did just now (*)
2) Agree
3) Question her about giving money to someone else

Wendy:
I was in her debt a long time ago.

(leaving village north)

Wendy:
Is it all right to go outside already? We haven't forgotten anything?

1) Let's look one more time
2) It's okay to go (*)

Wendy:
Then, let's go!

Shuweizer:
The situation has changed. I will entrust dealing with the terrorists to you two.

Wendy:
Huh? What about Sir Shuweizer?

Shuweizer:
Other matters have come up. From here we will act separately.
At the time you deal with the terrorists, my duty will also end.
When that is finished, quickly withdraw to this village.
We will meet at the boat.

Wendy:
Y-yes...

Shuweizer:
Even after you've dealt with the terrorists, don't let yourselves be seen by the soldiers.
Monopolis doesn't want needless misunderstandings.
This mission is a great responsibility. I'm counting on you.

Wendy:
Well then, let's hurry! We don't have time to waste!

======================================
MISSION BATTLE 04 Assassinate the False Soldiers
[[Clear Conditions
- All enemies defeated

Game Over Conditions - Time runs out
- All party members defeated]]
--------------------------------------
Complete: Clear within 126 seconds of exiting Schizarz
Clear: Clear within 127-140 seconds of exiting Schizarz
Failed: More than 141 seconds pass since exiting Schizarz
======================================

[Time limit and remaining time is displayed in a meter at top right of screen. Please beware to not let time run out.]

(go northwest)

Wendy:
It looks like the disguised soldiers are not here yet. They are to come from the west, but I wonder from what area?

[Will you confirm the strategy's main points?]
1) Confirm (*)
2) Confirmation is unnecessary

[Strategy plan: Deal with the terrorists who are disguised as Hingistan and Fomeros soldiers before they engage the real soldiers.
Important points: -Do not let the soldiers and the impostors come into contact with each other
-All of the impostor soldiers must be annihilated
-You must not be discovered by the legitimate solders (they are indicated in green on the radar)
-After the attack is complete, return quickly to Schizarz village.]

Wendy:
Well then, let's go!

[[Clear Conditions
- Defeat all impostor soldiers

Game Over Conditions
- All party members defeated
- Fomeros soldiers attacked by the imposters
- Hingistan soldiers attacked by the imposters
- Party discovered by the actual soldiers (represented by green points on radar)]]

(go to west of map. after waiting, false soldiers enter from west)

False Hingistan Soldier:
Who are you! We will arrest you if you get in the way of Hingistan army's actions!

Wendy:
Even if you are acting like Hingistan soldiers, I can see that you are terrorists!

False Hingistan Soldier:
Tch! Then die!

(defeating terrorist)

False Hingistan Soldier:
Damn! These guys are from Monopolis!?
They're vultures who make a profit from war by selling weapons to each country!
By prolonging the war, they're going to keep sucking sweet sap as much as they can!

False Fomeros Soldier:
Our comrade who is disguised as Hingistan has been obstructed! We should carry out our duty as much as possible.

(blocking a false Fomeros soldier)

False Fomeros Soldier:
Tch, I don't know where you came from, but I can't allow you do disturb us!

(all terrorists defeated)

Wendy:
The terrorists are no longer here.

Fomeros Soldier:
Hm? Wasn't there some noise?

Fomeros Soldier:
It may be good to go look.

Wendy:
If we don't hurry out of here, we'll be discovered!

[[Clear Conditions
- Merklich escapes via east point of map

Game Over conditions
- All party members defeated
- Party discovered by the actual soldiers (represented by green dots on radar)]]

(go east, and go back to town)

Wendy:
I wonder what Shuweizer's task was? Has he returned already?

1) He's actually lazing off in the village
2) He is carrying out an important mission (*)
3) Do not reply

Wendy:
That must be so. An important job that he can't tell us.
At any rate, we must make preparations to return to the office.

(talk to man at boat)

Man:
We will depart after Shuweizer returns.

Wendy:
As expected, he is off somewhere...

(walk toward village exit)

Shuweizer:
You're returned? It looks like the operation was a success.

Wendy:
Yes.
By the way, where did you go?

Shuweizer:
When you were battling with the terrorists, I thought I would look for more terrorists in hiding somewhere, but apparently others did not come.
If they appeared, I intended to follow behind them and strike their headquarters...

Wendy:
Strike their headquarters? Do you mean by yourself?

Shuweizer:
Do you mean I alone would be impossible?

Wendy:
No, I didn't mean that...

Shuweizer:
For the success of a surprise attack, absolute numbers are unnecessary.
If you are alone, then you just use a method that will be successful with one person.

1) The side which is not discovered by the enemy has the advantage (*)
2) You only need to defeat the enemy general
3) Because you have the strength to fight on your own
4) It's just impossible alone
5) Remain silent

Shuweizer:
That's correct. For surprise attacks, you have to infiltrate without being discovered. If one is alone, it would be the most difficult to be discovered.
All right, then let's return to the office. Board the boat.

(use the boat and go back to Makinus)

Shuweizer:
All right, you must be tired from the mission.
The report to the higher-ups is my work. I will give you until tomorrow to rest.

Wendy:
Yes, thank you very much!

Shuweizer:
Then, you're dismissed.

Wendy:
Thanks for your hard work. We're unexpectedly a good combiation, aren't we?

1) Agree (*)
2) Deny
3) Remain silent

Wendy:
Hehe, let's do well from now on too!
So then, I wonder what to do now...

(go to headquarters door)

Monopolis Staff:
It looks like the Hingistan and Fomeros peace talk was a failure after all.

Merklich:
1) Ask why (*)
2) Remain silent

Monopolis Staff:
Somehow, the peace delegate was killed by someone. Hingistan and Fomeros are suspecting each other.
We can't deny the possibility of terrorists, but it doesn't seem so.

Merklich:
1) Claim that the terrorists are to be blamed
2) Agree that it's not done by the terrorists (*)
3) Remain silent

Monopolis Staff:
Yes. If we see that there's no criminal declaration, it's not the terrorists.
Well, if there became peace, then our company's products won't sell, so we're hoping it's so.

Merklich:
1) Agree
2) Can't agree (*)
3) Ask him why

Monopolis Staff:
You're saying peace is better than the sales of our products?
If you say such things, you'll get fired from the company, you know.

(go to 8F data room)

Wendy:
Complete file lookup... Maxwell...
The records of five years ago are gone...
...If that's so...

(approach Wendy)

Wendy:
Aagh! Hey, don't surprise me like that! I thought my heart would stop...
That reminds me, did you hear?
The seal on the closed-off continent has been lifted!

1) I heard about it
2) I didn't know that
3) Ask her what is she doing (*)

Wendy:
I'm just researching. Because I've entered the Red Wolves, I'll do anything to help my missions.
Well then, I'll be going now. See you tomorrow!

(exit headquarters and go to dorms left of it to rest)

Manager:
Welcome back. Will you return to you room?

Merklich:
1) Make a room for me (*)
2) I want to save

Manager:
Then, please enter your ID here.
(select Monopolis ID)

Manager:
Yes, cleared. Rest leisurely.

(go in right room and use bed)

[Will you rest on bed?]
1) Yes (*)
2) No

Manager:
Merklich, are you here?
An officer just came and said for you to come to the officer's room tomorrow morning.
So then, I've passed it to you!

(leave room)

Wendy:
Ah, good morning. I believe we would be summoned now. It was to come to the officer's room immediately.

(go to headquarters 10th floor and knock on office door)

Shayer:
Enter.

Wendy:
You summoned us?

Shayer:
Are you the last ones?

Wendy:
I'm sorry.

Shayer:
Considering yesterday's event, I will overlook it.
So then, we don't have time so I'll get straight to the point.
You've probably heard that the seal of the scapegoat land "Goatland" has been broken. You two have been chosen to head there as special project members.
I assume you will accept it?

Wendy:
Yes, understood!

Shayer:
On the outside you will escort the business team, but at the same time there is another duty.

Wendy:
Another duty?

Shayer:
It's a special task given by Monopolis Commander Brandole.
Using this sensor, if you find an object that that makes the response exceed 100, or if the size is over 100 meters, report it.

+Obtained Artifact Sensor!+

Wendy:
Search for an object that makes the sensor react...
And whether the reaction number is above 100, or the size is above 100 meters...
Concretely, what kind of thing is that?

Shayer:
Commander Brandole said "the power that is said to be in Goatland". It's vague, but that's all I was told.
However, even if it's vague, it's a duty given directly from the commander. Hold no suspicions and fulfill it.
Goatland is a continent that is completely unknown. We do not know what kind of dangers are there. I'll be looking forward to your work.
Now then, head toward the speed boat you used a few days ago. Sir Shuweizer should be waiting.

Wendy:
Yes, understood!

(go outside to Shuweizer at docks)

Shuweizer:
You're here, huh?
This is the last boat. Let's depart right away.
Board when you are ready. If you still have preparations to do, finish them quickly.

(board the larger boat)

Wendy:
A different continent, huh? I wonder when this mission will end...?

1) Ask what's wrong (*)
2) Do you hate it?
3) You don't wish to leave this continent?

Wendy:
Huh!? Did something happen?
I'm sorry. I was just deep in thought.
Speaking of which, we are to go overseas?
On this land, Screapers have disappeared because of the effects of Pollumine, but for a foreign land, isn't that Screaper territory?
Isn't it dangerous? I wonder what will happen there.

1) I'm worried too
2) If we get attacked, we just need to defeat the enemies (*)
3) Can't be helped even if you are worried about it

Wendy:
Well, that may be true but, it used to be that a whole troop was needed to defeat one Screaper!
Well, it's an old story so maybe it was exaggerated...
Anyway, I'll set that aside for now. Let's be off quickly!

Shuweizer:
We've departed without incident.
Until we reach the destination, there's not particularly anything to do. Do enjoy the cruise.
Before you go into your assigned boat rooms, I have something to give to each of you.

Wendy:
I wonder what it is?

Shuweizer:
All right, enter the rooms.

Wendy:
Huh? Umm, Sir Shuweizer!

Shuweizer:
What is it?

Wendy:
We didn't get something...

Shuweizer:
There is no need. You already have it.

Wendy:
We have it? Just what is it?

(talk to captain)

Captain:
What's the matter? First, how about moving the luggage to the rooms?
It's a long trip ahead. We shall go carefreely.

(go inside the boat)

[Will you save?]
1) Save
2) Don't save

Wendy monolog:
It's been ten days since we boarded the boat. Everyday passes with boredom with nothing to do.

(talk to man in gray suit by the boxes)

Monopolis Staff:
There is a new type of Pollumine seedling in this wooden box.

1) Ask what is Pollumine
2) Listen silently (*)

Monopolis Staff:
This new Pollumine has been improved over the previous one.
It not only removes toxins from the continent, it revives the soil.
In short, harvesting crops will increase, and people's lifetstyles can be more abundant.
And of course, it still has the frequency that Screapers dislike!

Merklich:
1) What are Screapers? (*)
2) Agree 
Monopolis Staff:
I haven't seen them before, but they seem to go after humans and they're the strongest monsters living at the waterside.

(talk again)
Monopolis Staff:
Screapers seem to be repellent to Pollumine trees. If we plant this many, then I think that Screapers won't appear even near the sea.

(talk to soldier on left side of boxes)

Monopolis Soldier:
That continent hasn't had any contact outside for thousands of years.
Therefore I think its level of technology is lower, but according to reports of the advance party, it doesn't seem to be as low as I thought.
But then, we have been ruined once, so maybe it is about the same.

(talk to soldier looking north)

Monopolis Soldier:
Say, do you know about Screapers? They've been around for hundreds of years, so they're like human's natural enemy.
If they get on land, then our corporation's Pollumine can deal with them. But on a ship, it's a little uneasy, I think?
If we have strength like Sir Shuweizer, then maybe we don't even have to fear Screapers...
If it comes to that, what should we do? I wonder if it's better to ask directly?

(talk to soldier at east)
Monopolis Soldier:
If we have to fight Screapers, do you know what to do?
We are to leave it to Shuweizer, and we'll support from the back.

By the way, I happened to overhear, but Shuweizer's strength is supposedly from a certain item.
If I also had that, I wonder if I could become as strong as Shuweizer?

(talk to Wendy)

Wendy:
I'm not good with boats... I wonder how far until we reach land?
Why didn't we use a high-speed boat like we did before?
Is there a reason we're using this old type of boat?

1) Answer her (*)
2) I don't know
3) Remain silent

1) There are not enough other boats
2) High speed boats are only suitable for short traveling distances
3) To match the civilization level to that of the destinated continent (*)

Wendy:
I see, it's so we don't make them alert and suspicious! Therefore, it's like a disguise!
Even so, if we don't make it there soon, I'm going to get seasick...

(talk to Shuweizer)

Shuweizer:
Do you understand what this mission is about?

1) Yes, I understand (*)
2) No, I don't

1) Serve as bodyguards for the company's personnel
2) To get rid of the terrorists
3) To search for reactions to the sensor (*)

Shuweizer:
Right. It's a special order from my father, Monopolis president.
My father's instructions are always beyond understanding, but they always produce benefits. This time will also turn out that way, I believe.

(talk again)

Shuweizer:
Hm? You want to know my countermeasure for Screapers?
I have a gem called Penetration. It's very effective only to Screapers.
It's a high-priced gem but not normally distributed, so it's not generally seen by people.
I received it a long time ago from a good broker at El Hingis, capital of Hingistan.
Well, if you also want one, you'll have to buy it from that man. However, it's not an easy price to pay.

(talk to captain)

Captain:
What's the matter?

Merklich:
1) When will we reach the destination? (*)
2) Why is this ship old?
3) Nothing in particular

Captain:
Proceeding with favorable conditions, we're calculated to see land around tomorrow afternoon.
Well, let's relax and not be impatient.
If there's nothing to do, you can sleep in the rooms.

(go inside ship quarters)

[Return to room?]
1) Yes (*)
2) No

[Will you save up to here?]
1) Save
2) Don't save

(talk to Wendy)

Wendy:
Say, is it true that you don't have memories?
Actually, my memories are a little unstable too.

1) Ask her who did she hear that from
2) Listen to the details (*)
3) Remain silent

Wendy:
We first met at the laboratory on the day it was attacked, right?
But even before that, it seems like we've met before. Shuweizer too.
But I don't remember it at all... I remember things before that, but only that period of several days is gaping wide...
It's only a few days for me, but it seems you lost all your memories?

1) I want to recall them all (*)
2) It is not inconvenient to the present condition
3) Remain silent

Wendy:
Yes, I see. I knew it would become a worry.
Well, my case is probably fine either way if I don't have the memories.

(talk to Captain)

Captain:
What's the matter?

Merklich:
1) When will we reach the destination? 2) Why is this ship old? (*)
3) Nothing in particular

Captain:
It's not as old as it appears, you know. It looks like this to be a disguise.
According to reports of the advance party, that continent's civilization seems to be less advanced than us.
If we came riding a high-developed ship, it would cause them alert, you see?
Well, let's relax and not rush.
If you have nothing to do, you can sleep in the rooms.

(enter ship quarters)

Captain:
Aaghh! What are these monsters!

Wendy:
These... are monsters from legend... Screapers?

Shuweizer:
It doesn't matter what they are! If we don't fight them the ship will sink!
We should be reaching land soon, so sinking here would be a humiliation!

======================================

(Shuweizer defeats a Screaper)

Shuweizer:
With these, Screapers are small fry!
If you calm down, we can defeat them! Do not neglect support to each person!

(Shuweizer defeats another Screaper)

Shuweizer:
All right, two are remaining!

(after a while)

Wendy:
Hang on here, our attacks are not effective? That there is such a creature...!

(Bishop Screaper appears)

Wendy:
There's one that big..?

Shuweizer:
Tch! Is there nothing more that can be done?
We can't go against it! Flee!

--------------------------------------

Female voice:
Hello? Hello, Sir Hero?
Sir Hero, please wake up...
Sir Hero, please wake up!

Fairy:
Have you come to your senses?
Are you all right?

1) I am fine (*)
2) My body hurts
3) Who are you?
4) What is this place?

Fairy:
Ah, that is good. You washed up from the sea, and you are safe.
First, I must introduce myself...
I am a fairy named Yurii. I came to help the hero. I will be pleased to serve you.

Wendy:
Uh.. unn...

Shuweizer:
...Damn... that was an awful incident.
Are we the only survivors...?

Yurii:
Yes, it is regrettable.
We can't deny the possibility that they could have washed up in another place, but...

Wendy:
Huh, a fairy...?

Shuweizer:
What is it, you are..?

Yurii:
I am a fairy, Yurii.

Shuweizer:
Is this place the sealed continent, Goatland?

Yurii:
Sealed...
It is not called Goatland, but this continent had been sealed by a barrier until one month ago.

Shuweizer:
Then, where are we?

Yurii:
This is Warslee village, situated in central south of the continent.

Shuweizer:
Warslee village? Then, to go to the place called Geilenach would be...

Yurii:
To Geilenach, it is east when you exit the village.
Crossing the east bridge, head straight east...

Shuweizer:
Straight east, huh?
All right, depart immediately.
We cannot let the project fail because of us.

Yurii:
I shall guide you. Let us go, Sir Hero!

Wendy:
Hero? Merklich is the hero?

Yurii:
Yes, that is right.
For a long time, we fairies have had a prophesy which has been handed down.
"At the time the seal of the continent is lifted, a hero will appear anew. The fairy with power will help the hero, and will have to return peace to the world again."
It is a prophesy left from 2000 years ago, at the time this continent was sealed.

Wendy:
That much time ago? To have such words from that long ago...

Yurii:
Do you not believe it? Ahh...

Wendy:
Oh, I still haven't introduced myself. I'm Wendy.

Yurii:
I am called Yurii.
Is it that I cannot have you believe my words?

Wendy:
I can believe that it's a prediction from 2000 years ago, but the contents are a little...
How did they know about now at such a long time ago?

Yurii:
That is perhaps because of the difference in senses between humans and fairies.
Although I say that, you may be skeptical, but fairies can feel the flow of time.
In the same manner as the present, we see the past and the future...

Wendy:
You know what the future is?

Yurii:
Yes. However, the matter called the future is a an extention of the actions of the present. So, it will minutely change according to what is done now.

Wendy:
So isn't it like it's unknown?

Yurii:
It is very difficult to explain the feeling. ...I know. For example, that tree over there...

That tree will probably be there five years later, right?

Wendy:
Well, in five years it could probably wither.
But looking at its situation, it looks like it could be kept five years later?

Yurii:
After five years that tree will not be there. By considerable probability...

Wendy:
Huh?

Yurii:
Four years from now, that tree will break from a storm.

Wendy:
So you can know the future...?

Yurii:
To know is to only go by the highest direction within the possibilities of the future.
However, humans intervene with their volitions, so reading the future has become very difficult.
It would be easy to read if only natural phenomenons occurred like before.

Wendy:
So then, you say he is the hero of prophesy.

Yurii:
Because human volitions intervene, there is no certainty, but I believe he is...

[Yurii became an ally!
The fairy Yurii will accompany Merklich. Yurii will not basically participate in battle, but from now will learn helpful abilities upon the travel.]

(leave the beach)

Wendy:
Ohh... ruins...?

Yurii:
Several days ago, Screapers attacked and the village was destroyed.
The inn is intact, so how about resting first?
You two still look fatigued.

Wendy:
Yes, that's so...
Ah, that reminds me, I'll pass this to you!
Yes, a map of this continent.

+Obtained Goatland Map!+

Yurii:
I can generally guide you, but that is certainly convenient.

(to go inn, talk to innkeeper)

Innkeeper:
Welcome.

Merklich:
1) Rest (*)
2) Save

Innkeeper:
A lot of things were destroyed so we can't offer comfortable hospitality. Today there is no charge.

Yurii:
Good morning. Have you rested well?

Wendy:
Huh? You changed your clothes?

Yurii:
Yes. The other dress limited my movement.
To a more important matter, we should head to Geilenach and follow that person now.

Wendy:
Ah, that was right! Then, please guide us!

Yurii:
Yes, please do entrust it to me.

[Fairy Command has been added! To confirm Yurii's abilities, press START and select the Fairy Command.]

Innkeeper:
Incidentally, will you record?

Merklich:
1) Yes 2) No

(leave the village)

Yurii:
There is a bridge to cross the water east of here.
Pass that and head straight east to reach Grangale kingdom's capital Geilenach.

(go east, walk on bridge)

Wendy:
Eh? What's that, monsters flying in the sky!?

Yurii:
They are Queen Screapers.
They are a calamity sealed in this continent. They have awoken.

Wendy:
A calamity that awoke?

Yurii:
Correctly speaking, one was defeated.
However, from the pieces of flesh of the defeated one, the Queen regenerated, and the result is there are now tens of them from one body.

(talk to Grangale guard)

Grangale Army Captain:
You are faces I haven't seen before. Where are you from?

Wendy:
We are from Monopolis company.

Grangale Army Captain:
Monopolis? I've never heard that name.

Grangale Soldier:
Captain. This morning there was a message from the capital. Is it about this?

Grangale Army Captain:
That group of merchants? Now that you say it, it was called that name.

Wendy:
We are people from that group.

Grangale Army Captain:
If that's so why are you acting separately? Are you searching for something?

Yurii:
No, their boat was sunken. They washed up in Warslee village.

Grangale Army Captain:
Aren't you the Queen of Pixies, Yurii?

Yurii:
You know of me? I am honored.

Grangale Army Captain:
Fairies would not deceive humans. Furthermore, there is no suspecting the Queen of Pixies.
Understood, I will believe you and let you pass.

Yurii:
I appreciate it.

Wendy:
You must be famous, Yurii. Thanks to you we got by without trouble.

Yurii:
So that I could meet the hero someday, I continued devoting myself as much as I could.
I am honored to be helpful.

(go east)

Yurii:
The capital Geilenach is east ahead of this desert.

Wendy:
A desert, huh? It may be difficult to pass.

Yurii:
Then immediately south of here is a town called Zaramba. How about putting preparations in order there?

(go south to Zaramba, enter inn and talk to innkeeper)

Innkeeper!
Ohh! The Queen of Pixies is following you!
I was secretly aiming for that!
...Sigh...
Well then, I'll come to my senses.
Welcome.

Merklich:
1) Rest
2) Save

Innkeeper:
I'll be waiting for you to come again.

(exit Zaramba and go east 2 maps)

Terrorist:
What's wrong, boy? You may be a supporter of justice, and you only got this far?

Boy:
...How unlucky... I've gotten swallowed up into trouble...

Monopolis Soldier:
Leave me be... You hurry... and run.

Boy:
If I could, I would, but it looks like they won't let me through.

Monopolis Soldier:
Sorry... I got in your way. Take... this...

Boy:
What's this?

Monopolis Soldier:
This...

+The boy received a crystal-like object!+

Terrorist:
Well, is it time to pay your dues?

Terrorist:
Uh, wagh, what's that!?

Monopolis Soldier:
...A Screaper...!?
Hey... you... Don't lose this seedling...
This seedling will...that thing... ugh...

Boy:
Hey! You!
Ugh! He went and died willfully.
I'll have to cut through here alone...

Wendy:
What is it with these monsters?

Yurii:
It's serious! A person is being attacked!

Terrorist:
Grr! It's the lot from that corporation! Dispose of them!

Wendy:
There are terrorists!?

Complete: 1 or less enemies not defeated by party and Rukias
Clear: 2 enemies not defeated by party and Rukias

======================================

Terrorist:
Damn, this monster...

Merklich:
1) Say that you will deal with them all (*)
2) Say that we should cooperated to defeat the Screaper

Terrorist:
Don't be absurd! I will kill you before you can!

Boy:
...That man... could he be the heroic protector, the Brave Guard?

(approach boy)

Boy:
...Tch!

Merklich:
1) Give instructions to the boy (*)
2) Let him do as he likes

1) Fight where you are
2) Come to my side (*)
3) Go to Wendy's side

Boy:
Ah, understood!

(approach the Screaper)

Boy:
What are you doing? We can't fight this thing!

Wendy:
If there's only one, we can do it but it will take endurance!

(after fighting Screaper a while)

Boy:
This thing just won't die!

Yurii:
Please keep trying! Just endure a bit more!

(after defeated everything)

Wendy:
Huu, looks like it's ended.
Are you all right?

Boy:
Well...
More importantly, you're the Brave Guard, right? What are you doing in such a place?

Wendy:
Huh? You know him?

Boy:
Furthermore, you're with a woman. She isn't the Shrine Maiden, right?

Wendy:
!!
What do you mean?

Yurii:
Sir Hero. Do you know this boy?

Boy:
(If they don't know this much, is it an accidental resemblance?
But, the symbol on his face is...)

Wendy:
Maybe you're his acquaintance, but if he doesn't remember you, don't get mad. He actually lost all his memories...

Boy:
No, I don't know him personally. It's because he has many features that resemble someone I've heard of.
Anyway, what will you do from now?
If you're going east, then I want to go together. I would be able to travel safely with you guys.

Wendy:
We are only going to a city called Geilenach.

Boy:
For the time being, going up to there would be fine.

Wendy:
What will we do?

1) Leave it to Wendy
2) Go together (*)
3) Refuse
4) Remain silent

Wendy:
That would be good.

Boy:
You've helped me.
I am Rukias.

Wendy:
I'm Wendy. This fairy is Yurii, and he is...

1) Tell him your name (*)
2) Don't tell him your name

[Rukias joined as a traveler!
Travelers
On the way of traveling, characters which join the party temporarily are called travelers. They are among the party members but cannot be directly commanded. If you let them die, it will be Game Over so beware.]

(go east)

Wendy:
Say, Yurii. What's this "rana seed" that we got from the battle?

Yurii:
Ah, that?
Rana fruits and rana seeds and fruits that let us fairies grow.
By using that at training time, we can raise the effects of training.

Wendy:
Oh, is that so...

Yurii:
Training requires time, so please call me when you visit an inn to use rana fruits and seeds.

Wendy:
When you do training, what happens?

Yurii:
The same as humans; learn various skills.
I think they would be helpful in the hero's adventure, so please give me your instructions when we visit an inn.

(keep going east 2 screens)

Wendy:
Aagh!

Yurii:
What is the matter, Wendy!?

Wendy:
Ahaha, nothing. It's nothing.

Rukias. ...You say so, but that scream wasn't normal.

Yurii:
What really happened?

Wendy:
...Well.. an insect... got stuck on my sleeve...

1) Be shocked
2) Ask her if she dislikes insects (*)
3) Laugh
4) I got your weak point!

Wendy:
Yes! It's not that I'm weak to them, they're just no good!

Rukias:
If you say insects are no good, then are fairies also no good?

Yurii:
Ehh? Me?

Wendy:
No, it's fine! Yurii is completely fine!
The ones I hate are those "stomach" ones!
They have tons of legs, and when they breathe it moves? Ugh, yuck, yuck!
Ewww! I can't stand just imagining it!

Yurii:
Certainly everyone has something they're weak to, right?

Wendy:
You have one too, right? One or two things that you dislike?
It's not fair that only I have revealed my weakness. Now, tell yours too!

1) I'll never tell you
2) Tell her (*)
3) Ignore her

Wendy:
What, what?

1) Sweets
2) Women (*)
3) Work

Wendy:
Ah.. is that so? You want to say that you can't stand me...
If that's so. then I'm going to stick it to you straight!

Yurii:
You two seem to be close friends...

(enter Geilenach)

Yurii:
This is Grangale kingdom's capital, Geilenach.

Rukias:
This is the place you were traveling until for the time being.
If you need me, call me.
I will return the debt.

Wendy:
So then, we have to look for Sir Shuweizer.

(go east to the flying glowing light)

Lily:
Ah, Yurii.

Yurii:
It is Lily, isn't it? It is unusual to see you come to Geilenach.

Lily:
Zerdok is no more, so I came to accompany that person's work today.
Speaking of which, it is unusual for you Yurii to be with a human, isn't it?
Is that person perhaps...?

Yurii:
Yes, the hero that I believe in.

Lily:
Congratulations, Yurii. Now you can also know the pleasure of being with a special person.

Yurii:
Oh, my...

Lily:
You do not need to be embarrassed. If we just have the partner we devote to, we can become stronger.
And especially Yurii, you diligently worked for the sake of the hero that hadn't been seen before. Am I incorrect?

Yurii:
That is true. I cannot bring disgrace to the hero.

Lily:
Yurii's hero, please look well after Yurii.

Monopolis Soldier:
You've made it here. Sir Shuweizer is in front of the castle further in.

(go east)

Yurii:
Ah, you! It is Nora!

Nora:
Oh, Yurii! Hello!

Yurii:
There must be some reason you've come to Geilenach?

Nora:
No, it's not important. I only came concerning master's business.
Ah, yes!
Say, Yurii, do you know this?

+Obtained Rana Pouch!+

Nora:
It's a pouch to keep Rana fruits and seeds. Rana fruits are quite valuable.
It's no use for me to have two, so I'll give you one!

Yurii:
My, thank you very much.

Nora:
Well then, I am going to return to Jaergen with my master, so I'll excuse myself.
If you come to Jaergen, please visit us!

Yurii:
Yes. Take care of yourself too, Nora!

(knock on house in right)

Woman:
My, my, isn't it the Queen of Pixies, Yurii!
You've finally found a suitable person, huh? Please keep doing well from now on too! I will cheer for you.
Yes, to congratulate you I will give you clothes that will suit you!

+Obtained Fairy Costume Festival Clothes!+

Yurii:
My, it's very nice! Thank you very much!

[By selecting "Summon Yurii" at the reception in the Inn, you may change clothes with the costumes you obtain. Even if you don't make her change, Yurii may freely change clothes as she likes.]

(go north and approach righthand group of people)

Sales Staff:
Therefore, with the characteristic scent of Pollumine that our firm has developed, Screapers will not come near.
Since we started using this in our country, damage from Screapers has been reduced to almost zero.

Pothrad:
However, this tree also absorbs the power of the earth, doesn't it?
On this continent where vitality has weakened, planting those trees would accelerate the decay of the land.
The effects would be seen as soon as one year later...

Wendy:
It looks like a disagreement.

(talk to Gaerik)

Gaerik:
Because of the intervention of the Peace Mainenance Brigade, Queen Screapers have multiplied. Since then, damage from the Queen Screapers has just been increasing.
If we can reduce the damage from Screapers with your Pollumine, then to us it would be appreciated.
However, according to the Pothrad then the land's vitality will be impoverished, and will affect our lives.
...We can't make a decision easily.

Wendy:
He seems young but he's the commanding officer here?

Yurii:
He is Captain Gaerik of the Grangale army. In a previous battle the lietenant general was lost, so his rank is captain but he manages the other soldiers in his position.

Wendy:
I see. He must be very able.

(flashback and exposition anime cut-scene)

Yurii:
The Peace Maintenance Brigade was formed twenty years ago and stopped war on the continent by reviving a great ancient weapon and using its power.

Wendy:
A great weapon's power?

Yurii:
The Admonisher was a very powerful weapon. By one shot, it could instantly make a whole land perish, and kill several hundred people.

Wendy:
What a tremendous weapon... It seems a lot like Hingistan's giant.
But if they had such a powerful weapon, couldn't they use it to kill the Queen Screaper?

Yurii:
Actually, it was already used. When that Queen was still alive, the Admonisher crashed into the Queen's seal to break it.

Wendy:
Wow... Even with such a strong weapon, it couldn't destroy the Queen...

(talk to Monopolis soldier)

Monopolis Soldier:
We cannot rush negotiations. The secret of success is to have patience.
...Looking at it like this, I think it will really be so.

(talking to other Monopolis soldier)

Monopolis Soldier:
Having been closed off for a long time, there still remains a very strong royal system here.

(talking to other Monopolis soldier wearing white)

Monopolis Soldier:
This is the first time I've performed as Shayer's escort, but this negotiations is difficult.

(talk to Shayer)

Wendy:
Miss Shayer has also come here?

Shayer:
I arrived this morning.
I heard the story from Shuweizer, but it seems like many guard members became victims when coming here.
However, we cannot cancel our project. Even if you must hire arms from this land, please work to continue the project.

Wendy:
Yes, understood.
At any rate, what were they discussing about?

Shayer:
About Pollumine which our company developed.
We do not mean any harm, but because this world hasn't had outside contact for a long time, they can't help having discretion.
We shall perform our negotiations with patience.
Anyway, leave the matters here to me. You shall meet with a sales staff in Jaergen north of here and head west.

(talk to Shuweizer)

Shuweizer:
You finally made it?
You didn't have to fight the huge monsters flying in the sky?

Wendy:
Yes, we are all right.

Shuweizer:
I see.
In a little while, we will head north. Make your preparations.
Nevertheless, those flying monsters are worrisome.
You two, wait a little bit...

Yurii:
Exactly what does that person intend to do?

Wendy:
It seems that he knows a way to defeat those things flying in the sky...

Yurii:
Impossible, I do not think there is a way. Normal humans cannot defeat a Queen Screaper.
Not even Korin's hero was able to defeat one.

Wendy:
Who is that?

Yurii:
A person from the Peace Maintenance Brigade, he once defeated a Queen.
His name is...

(choose a name)
[Haschen] ゼオンシルト

Wendy:
That person defeated a Queen Screaper?

Yurii:
Yes. However, the results are as you have seen...

Wendy:
They've increased excessively...

Yurii:
Just now... the reality has changed? ...Korin's hero is...?

Wendy:
What happened, Yurii?

Yurii:
Eh? No, it was nothing.

Wendy:
Huh? That person a while ago, Gaerik? Where did he go?

Yurii:
Huh?

Pothrad:
However, now that Sir Ziekwalt has destroyed the Queen Screaper, then planting that many trees quickly is...

Grangale Captain:
But now that Sir Gaerik and Sir Rufus are killed by Ziekwalt, our country has no Slayers!
If we have to rely on that Pollumine in order to counter the Screapers...

Wendy:
What? He just said Gaerik was killed? But, he was just there a while ago!
Furthermore, wasn't it a PMB person who defeated the Queen?

Yurii:
Umm, you can perceive that the reality has changed?

Wendy:
Whatever that is, what they've said is completely contradictory.

Yurii:
I will tell you, but I think it would be better if we don't say it to other people.
To ordinary people, they can't perceive the difference so I think they will not believe it.

1) I can't act according to something that I cannot agree with
2) What does that mean? (*)
3) I don't understand why but I'll just do accordingly

Yurii:
The truth is that the reality of the past has been changed due to an unknown person.

Wendy:
The reality of the past?
Then that means history has changed?

Yurii:
Yes, it has become so.
It is extremely rare, but it is possible that the flow of time can change, like the flow of a river.
However, because humans can't sense that, they won't notice anything even if history has changed.
However, you two can realize that...

Wendy:
Fairies can perceive that?

Yurii:
Fairies have strong points and weak points among them, so however far they can perceive it will differ.
However, in general fairies can know that history changed.
I am particularly strong in that area, so I can sharply perceive it more than other fairies.

Wendy:
So then, concretely, what has changed?

Yurii:
In the past, the Queen was defeated by a person named Ziekwalt.
Furthermore, he gave his life to kill and seal the Queen.

Wendy:
Then, the Peace Maintenance Brigade person is?

Yurii:
Korin's master who defeated the Queen before history changed, it seems he did not enter the Peace Maintenace Brigade.

Shayer:
Hey, you. What are you doing?
Go to Jaergen quickly, and meet with the other sales staff.
We've had reports of terrorist sightings, so do hurry.

Wendy:
Yes, understood!

(go south and west)

Rukias:
Ah, you guys. I have something I want to ask...
Isn't there something strange now?

Wendy:
What do you mean, strange?

Rukias:
I see...
For example, what happened to those huge monsters floating in the sky?

1) They didn't exist right from the beginning
2) Our ally destroyed them
3) Why do you ask that? (*)
4) Remain silent

Rukias:
It's not my imagination. Certainly they were there...

Yurii:
This person can also sense it...

Wendy:
What's the meaning of that?

Yurii:
I do not know either. Normal people are not supposed to sense it...

Wendy:
At any rate, Rukias, it's better if you don't tell other people. But we still can't say the reason.

Rukias:
Okay, I see. I'll also dismiss that I can see with strange eyes.
By the way, where are you going? The thing I was looking for wasn't here.
If you're going to another town, I want to go with you...

1) Agree (*)
2) Refuse
3) Leave the decision to Wendy

Rukias:
Thank you. If we meet enemies outside, I'll also fight. Feel free to give me instructions.

[Rukias joined your party!]

(go west)

Lily:
...Ah.. no.. no... Master Gaerik.... Master Gaerik...!

Yurii:
Lily...

(exit city)

Wendy:
Those things flying in the sky are really gone...
Well, our destination was Jaergen village?

Yurii:
Jaergen village is straight north of here. It's a fairly long distance and there are no towns on the way, so I think it would be wise to prepare here.

Wendy:
That's right. We don't know what will happen, so it could be serious if we neglect preparations.

(head north a few maps)

Yurii:
Huh? In the surroundings, there are people...

Rukias:
What, brigands?

Terrorist:
Monopolis company's people, huh?

Merklich:
1) Affirm(*)
2) Deny
3) Remain silent

Terrorist:
Then you can die here!

======================================

Terrorist:
These guys are stronger than I thought! All members go at them!

Terrorist leader:
Because of you selling weapons, war won't be gone from the world!

(after battle)

Yurii:
It looks like the enemies are gone.
Is what he said true?

Wendy:
Who said?

Yurii:
Because your company is selling weapons, the war can't end.

1) Affirm
2) Deny (*)
3) Can't say anything

Wendy:
That's right! After all, whatever that weapon is used for, is up to the person using it!

Rukias:
Well, if there is demand, then you supply there. There's no mistaking economics, but...

Wendy:
What?

Rukias:
Nothing really.
Well, let's go ahead.

Yurii:
Yes. Jaergen is close to here.

(go north and enter Jaergen)

Yurii:
This is Jaergen village.

Rukias:
It's not very lively.

Yurii:
Now it is Grangale territory, but originally it was Neylern kingdom's land.
That enmity still remains after twenty years have passed.

Wendy:
Friction of the controller and the suppressed, huh? Even in any land...

Yurii:
Wendy, is something the matter?

Wendy:
No, it's nothing.
Well, let's go meet with the company's staff.

(go inside inn)

Yurii:
Nora is here.

Nora:
Ah, Yurii, you came!
Good timing.

Yurii:
What's the matter?

Nora:
I was just going to go out.

Yurii:
Where will you go?

Nora:
It's a sketch travel, so I don't have a decided place. It could be the sea, the forest...

Yurii:
I see.
If you make another good painting, please show me.

Nora:
Yes, I definitely will.
Well, I'll be off!

Yurii:
Take care.

(talk to Neylern soldier)

Neylern Soldier:
I have no loss in dying... I didn't have Sir Ziekwalt take this life...

Merklich:
1) Ask what does he mean (*)
2) Listen silently

Neylern Soldier:
Sir Ziekwalt is a person who surpasses humans.
He could even defeat the Queen Screaper.
But the secret of that power is that he takes it from other people.
I also wanted to make my strength useful, but it didn't happen.
If he had my power, then maybe he wouldn't have died from the Queen...

(exit inn, go north to mansion and talk to Fanille)

Fanille:
Ah, guests again?
People from Monopolis are here inside my house...

Wendy:
Are you the daughter of the lord here?

Fanile:
Uh, yes. I am Fanille.

Yurii:
Fanille was a researcher at the Peace Maintenance Brigade.

Fanile:
Huh, how do you know that?

Yurii:
Uh, well... that...
I heard from Korin. You're a very fantastic researcher.

Fanille:
Oh, Korin said that?
Of course, fairies are friends so it's natural they'd talk to each other.
I was a little surprised.

Wendy:
But, why is a PMB researcher here?

Fanille:
The Dragon Orb was stolen and the Admonisher has fallen. The PMB can't do anything right now so it has dispersed.
The Peace Maintenance Brigade without Admonisher... no country would care about us.
If we had the Dragon Orb that Ziekwalt took away, then we could probably operate again...
Well, please come inside if you like.

Yurii:
I did something careless.

Wendy:
What's the matter?

Yurii:
In this history, I hadn't met Fanille.

Wendy:
It's a trouble that history has changed...

(talk to men in suits)

Wendy:
We came to meet you here according to Shayer's orders.

Sales Staff:
Ah, we were waiting.

Wendy:
How are the results?

Sales Staff:
They are great.
Well, let's head west. According to what we hear, there is a tunnel to pass the mountain in the west.
According to the arrangement, we will rely on you for escort.
We will be waiting outside the village, so please come as soon as you are ready.

(to go village's exit)

Sales Staff:
Shall we depart soon?

Merklich:
1) Yes (*)
2) No

Sales Staff:
Then, we will count on your protection.

[2 Monopolis staff members have become travelers!]

(exit and go west 2 maps)

Wendy:
By the way, I have a question.
When you went to that village, you didn't have an escort?

Sales Staff:
We arrived by boat at the beach of the ruins north of here.

Yurii:
That must be Nu Nahn.
It was destroyed by war twenty years ago and now has become ruins.

Sales Staff:
That is probably so. The people of Jaergen also said Nu Nahn.

Wendy:
So then, you will also leave by way of Nu Nahn?

Sales Staff:
Yes. We will probably be returning after we go over there.
Although, the ones we are to meet are still ahead.
Until then, it is our duty to make just one contract.

(go left)

Rukias:
Hmm?
Hey, we're surrounded.

Terrorist:
They've got good senses.

Sales Staff:
They're here...

Terrorist:
So you're going to further expand your influence by even coming to another continent?
If you get bigger, then it would be trouble!

Merklich:
1) That is the freedom of economic trade
2) It's for the sake of the world
3) It's the same no matter which enterprise wins (*)
4) It is indeed not good to monopolize the market
5) Remain silent

Terrorist:
Shut up!
By spreading Pollumine all over the world, you intend to monopolize the earth's power!
Die!

Rukias:
...Tch! It doesn't seem like they are the type we can discuss with...

Yurii:
What will we do?

Wendy:
We have to protect the staff members!

Sales Staff:
What should we do?

Merklich:
1) Stay close to Merklich
2) Stay close to Wendy
3) Stay close to Rukias
4) Stay in that place
5) Go ahead to the tunnel (*)

Sales Staff:
Understood!

You guys hurry too!

[[Clear Conditions

Game Over Conditions

(after battle)

Yurii:
It looks there are no more enemies.
Who were those people?

1) Terrorists (*)
2) People hired from rival companies
3) Don't answer

Yurii:
Terrorists?

Wendy:
On our continent, other countries take advantage of the neighboring country's internal discord. They intervene and it becomes war.
At first people who fought for revolution, and became dispersed, and changed into several organizations of terrorists.

Yurii:
Then, why do those terrorist organizations attack Monopolis?

Wendy:
Monopolis exports goods to Hingistan and Fomeros.
Therefore when that source is stopped, then it would be difficult to continue the war between the two countries.
By damaging Monopolis and making it withdraw from the two warring countries, then other enterprises would also withdraw seeing that.

Yurii:
Why is that? For Monopolis to withdraw, then doesn't it give another enterprise the chance to extend its hand?

Wendy:
That would be so if you're only looking at the market. What becomes key is the existence of a powerful private army held by Monopolis.
There is no other company that has an army as strong as Monopolis does.
For a corporation like Monopolis to withdraw is...

Yurii:
Then there wouldn't be benefit in having invested in an army, right? Naturally, other enterprises cannot cross swords...

Wendy:
It would appear so if Monopolis' private army were to yield to Terrorists.

Rukias:
So then, what do they think about making the common civilians fear for their lives?
Do they really think their revolution is a success when they are damaging the civilians?

1) It's because they act that way that they are terrorists
2) Agree with Rukias
3) The common civilians suffered no losses (*)

Wendy:
That's right. Recently it looks like there has been no damage toward civilians. The number of terrorist incidents are considerably reducing.

Rukias:
Why is it reducing?

Wendy:
From a certain time, their movements have been systematized.
For example, they not only destroy army facilities stationed in cities, they attack the Monopolis facilities in Jewarl... it seems.

Rukias:
Then that means...

1) The number of terrorist members decreased
2) Someone is gathering the terrorists together (*)
3) Remain silent

Wendy:
That's right.
The scattered members are now beginning to function as one organization...
From this just like up to now, it probably won't move.

(go through tunnel and get out other side)

Rukias:
We reach a snow country coming out of the tunnel?

Wendy:
It's cold. We have to go through such a place?

Yurii:
If we go west from here, there is a harbor.

Wendy:
That's a relief. I thought we'd have to walk the whole way.

Yurii:
Agh, that monster!

Wendy:
What's wrong with those monsters?

Yurii:
Those!? They like to eat fairies! Many of my kind have been eaten by those... please beware!

(go west and enter inn)

Innkeeper:
Welcome to the cold region. Shall I guide you to a room? We also deal with goods.

Merklich:
1) Rest (*)
2) Save
3) Shop
4) Summon Yurii

Yurii:
Ah, that person is...

Wendy:
Someone you know?

Yurii:
He is the son of the commander of the Peace Maintenance Brigade, Krious.

(talk to Krious)

Krious:
Hm?
You also have a fairy following you, huh? I also know someone with a fairy.

Wendy:
Who is that fairy?

Krious:
She's named Korin.
She was friends with a researcher, but that person resigned the Peace Maintenance Brigade, so it looks like Korin went home to the forest.
Anyway, I have something I want to ask, but do you know of someone named Ziekwalt?

1) I only know the name
2) It seems he fought the Queen (*)
3) I don't know anything
4) Remain silent

Krious:
What!? He fought the Queen?
Then, is he not alive any more?

Wendy:
I think that's what happened, isn't it?

Krious:
Damn! What should we do...

Wendy:
What's the matter?

Krious:
He had the Dragon Orb...

Wendy:
...Dragon Orb?

Yurii:
It is a gem that can take and gather the power flowing in the earth.

Rukias:
......

Krious:
Yes, As she said.
If we don't have that, then the Admonisher is... damn!

Wendy:
...Say, Merklich...
Could that "thing" that the company is looking for be that Dragon Orb?

1) Agree (*)
2) Deny
3) I don't know

Wendy:
I knew you'd think that too, huh?
Even so, what would the company do with it once they found it?

(go west to boat)

Captain:
This is a boat headed to Cyriltia.
The preparations will end in just a while. Please go wait inside.

Sales Staff:
We will pay the ship fees. Please board the boat.

(talk to Rukias)

Rukias:
Hey, you, what where you doing and where were you before you came here?

1) Monopolis guard duties (*)
2) I don't remember
3) Don't tell him

Rukias:
I see. But, what were you doing before that? No, sorry...
I said it at the time we met, but you look just like the one I heard about...
If you are that person, then my travel may also be finished...

1) Ask what is the purpose of his travel (*)
2) Remain silent

Rukias:
I have a few objectives, but one of them was to look for a certain person.
Sorry to say strange things.

(talk to Wendy)

Wendy:
This ship looks like the one we rode before. But, this one looks truly old.
I'm worried it may sink...

1) Agree
2) No need to worry (*)
3) Remain silent

Wendy:
Even though you say that, I'm weak with boats...
In any case, about what we discussed before. Do you think the Dragon Orb is what the company is looking for?"

1) I think so indeed (*)
2) I don't think so
3) I don't know

Wendy:
I knew it was so.
But from what we heard a while ago, a person named Ziekwalt took it away, right?
But, Ziekwalt was lost fighting the Queen Screaper.
If we investigate where they fought, then maybe we can find the Dragon Orb if we go there.

(talk to staff member in gray suit)
Sales Staff:
Our corporation's technology is thanks to the brilliance of the Commander's conceptualizations.
The commander not only manages the corporation, he also holds abundandant knowledge about technology.
He's truly an amazing person.

(talk to staff member in blue suit)
Sales Staff:
I never thought the terrorists would follow us to this continent.

Captain:
We will arrive shortly on the opposite shore. It will rock a bit, so please be careful.

Wendy:
Ahh, land feels good as ever.

Rukias:
So then, where do we go from here?

Sales Staff:
According to orders, we should head west to a place called Felmentia.

Yurii:
Felmentia? From here it is a little far.
On the way there is a village called Totuwa, so I think it would be good to go there first.

Sales Staff:
We will go with your pace. Do tell us when you are prepared.

(talk to staff member)
するかい？
Sales Staff:
Will we depart?

Merklich:
1) Yes (*)
2) No

Sales Staff:
Then, shall we go?

(go west)

Woman:
Stop there.

Wendy:
Who's there?

Woman:
Drop that seedling that you're holding.

Wendy:
Are you suddenly ordering us?

Rukias:
!?
Those eyes... is she the Shrine Maiden?

Woman:
We cannot plant more of those trees. So that you don't put this world into extinguishment, drop that seedling now!

Wendy:
We work for the sake of people's lives...

Woman:
If that's so you don't need to seek the Dragon Orb, right? What is your enterprise scheming!?

Wendy:
That's what we should be saying!
You're doing things as you please, like exploding the laboratory, making Fomeros and Hingistan collide, making everything be annihilated..!

Resistance Leader:
Do not take us as the same as the terrorists!
We are people from "Land's Prayer"!

Wendy:
Huh?
"Land's Prayer", the organization opposing Hingistan Kingdom's government? The Resistance?
Why is that Resistance in a place like this?

Woman:
Our objective is to save this planet. Well, hand over that Pollumine seedling!

Sales Staff:
We can't hand over an important item!

Resistance Leader:
Then we'll just have to take it by force!

======================================

Sales Staff:
Do not hand over the seedling!

Woman:
Those cheek marks... the Brave Guard!?
Why! Why is he with Monopolis?
It can't be, that pod...?

Resistance Leader:
(...What shall I do?)

Woman:
(...That man with the face tattoos... only capture him without killing him...)
......
(No, no, it's nothing. Just take the seedling!)

Resistance Leader:
(...Understood...)

Rukias:
The enemy has many archers! Be careful and don't let them concentrate!

(after battle)

Woman:
Kh! ...Even though this planet may be extinguished...
It's regrettable, but I can only flee from here...

Rukias:
Hey, wait! Aren't you the Shrine Maiden? Wait!

Wendy:
Hey, wait! If you also go off freely.. argh!
But why is the Resistance in a place like this?
Furthermore they knew Monopolis is here and came to attack?

1) The Resistance has turned into terrorists
2) They intend to steal the seedlings and use them as monetary resources
3) Because the seedlings are dangerous items (*)
4) I don't know

Wendy:
Is that so? But because of Pollumine then we don't have pollution...
But I'm wondering about the words "this planet may also be extinguished".

(go west and find Rukias)

Wendy:
Ah, you're here! What were you doing so suddenly?

Rukias:
......

Wendy:
Do you know that woman of the Resistance?
Somehow she also knew of Merklich...
If I remember right, she said "Brave Guard"...

Rukias:
...Sorry, it's a personal problem...

Wendy:
Hey, now...

Rukias:
I'm sorry. Give me a little time now.
I'm also confused...

Wendy:
It can't be helped.

Yurii:
Then, shall we rest at Totuwa?
Ahead of here there is an entrance to a village north.

(enter Totuwa)

Yurii:
This is Totuwa village.
It is still fairly long until Felmentia, so it would be good to rest here well.

Rukias:
There's nothing much here. Is there anything that changed here?

Yurii:
I see... we can ask details from my acquaintance.

Wendy:
Acquaintance?

Yurii:
Yes. A fairy named Mira, I think she is in the inn.

(approach futon dog)

Dog:
ha, ha...

Yurii:
This, this animal really likes you!

(enter inn and talk to innkeeper to rest)

Mira:
You have come, Yurii.

Yurii:
It has been a while, Mira. Did you perhaps know we were coming here?

Mira:
Yes, I saw it.
It looks like you finally found your hero, I see?

Yurii:
Yes. I am confident that he is the hero.
The reason I hadn't found him until now was that he was outside of this continent.

Mira:
Outside the continent... I see. It is no wonder then that even I couldn't see it.

Wendy:
Hey, Yurii, we don't know the situation, but...

Yurii:
Ah, I'm very sorry, Wendy.
She is Mira. She is one of the few fairies that even I acknowledge superiority.

Mira:
Nice to meet you. I am Mira.

Wendy:
Ah, nice to meet you too...
Well, it wasn't her name we wanted to know, it's how did she see that we were coming...

Yurii:
Yes. Of course, let me explain.
I believe I let you know about the difference between fairies and humans, that we can sense the past and future.
However, that "time reading" ability is different among fairies.
Even among many fairies, Mira's time reading ability is most excelling. Even I do not have that much power.

Wendy:
Wow, more incredible than Yurii.

Mira:
My hit ratio is is higher than other fairies. Let's place the standard.
An absolute success rate is impossible.
The future can be completely changed by a mere matter.
In particular, in one year's time the change was too radical. Thanks to that my ratio has lowered in turn.

Yurii:
Even Mira cannot read it? I couldn't do it by myself.

Mira:
The change here in one year can be said to be abnormal. Because of that the true future  cannot be seen. I also never thought the seal of the continent would break.

Yurii:
In other words, from the instability of the events in one year, that will give a great influence to the world's fate?

Mira:
Because the still uncertain elements are too many I don't want to say anything reckless, but in the worst case, this planet itself will end.

Rukias:
The planet itself will end?

Wendy:
That's what that Resistance woman was saying...
Just what does it mean?

Mira:
It is the case of the worst future coming to the last. Therefore, I can seldom say it.
However, I will predict this much.

Wendy:
Predict...?

Mira:
Whether that fate comes, or if you can evade it... all will be the work of your actions.

Wendy:
Our actions...

Mira:
And someone of your blood relative will fulfill the great role of deciding the future...

Rukias:
Our blood relative...?

Mira:
Because time is unstable, I can only say this much. I cannot convey your future further.

Yurii:
Mira...

Mira:
Such a face does not suit you, Yurii.
As always, go with confidence. Believe in the human you chose yourself.

Yurii:
Thank you, Mira.

Wendy:
So then, today we have a little free time, right?

Rukias:
Yeah. Is that fine?

(talk to Wendy outside)

Yurii:
Wendy, do you find something interesting?

Wendy:
...Ah, yes... lots of things.
The climate of the place I was born and raised in is like Grangale's south.
Therefore I find snow rare.

Yurii:
I also do not come here much, so snow is rare to me.
Nevertheless it's cold, isn't it. It must be difficult to live here.

Wendy:
For such a time, there's cooking!

Yurii:
Cooking?

Wendy:
In hot places, there is cooking that is suitable for heat. In cold places, there is cooking suitable for cold.
The knowledge gathered from living here must produce a unique type of cuisine.

Yurii:
...I see...
We fairies only need to be by plants and don't have to eat, so we never think about cooking.

Wendy:
I was talking to the shop person about ingredients. Incidentally, I was also told a way to make a warming cuisine!
When I can I'll make a dinner. Look forward to it, okay?

(go inside inn to the back)

Merklich:
1) Rukias' room (*)
2) Own room
3) Quit

Rukias:
Just what happened...? That was certainly the Shrine Maiden. She wasn't with the Brave Guard.
...Who is it?

1) Name yourself (*)
2) Ignore and open the door

Rukias:
It's you...
What is it? If it's not important, then leave now.

1) Came to see how Rukias is
2) Ask him who is that woman (*)
3) Leave the room

Rukias:
That woman...?
I'm sorry but I can't talk about that.
Furthermore, I'm confused, so I don't know what I should say.
If you are the one I am looking for, then I can talk about it.
Until then please wait.

By the way, you are really strong. How did you become that strong?

1) I have the all the qualities
2) Daily effort (*)
3) It's a secret

Rukias:
Efforts, huh? Certainly that's the best view.
But, looking at you it seems you don't have one certain thing.
For that I need to carefully observe more deeply...

Yurii:
I think Rukias is also strong enough.

Rukias:
That's no good! I'm still lacking!

Yurii:
Why are you looking for strength?

Rukias:
It's none of your business! This is my own issue!
It's bad of me, but can't you leave now?

Yurii:
Sir Hero, let's go outside. Rukias, excuse us.

(go to own room)

Wendy:
Aagh!

Yurii:
That was Wendy's scream just now!

Wendy:
...ha...ha...ha...

Yurii:
Wendy, what's the matter?

Wendy:
I was going to borrow the kitchen and do some cooking...
And then..

1) Was there a bug again? (*)
2) Did you cut your finger?

Wendy:
...No... Not a bug... not a bug, but...

Yurii:
...But...?

Wendy:
Is it all right? What I'm about to say now is really shocking!
It's very shocking, so prepare for it and listen well!

Yurii:
Y-yes...

Wendy:
I was cooking, so I could make dinner for everyone.
The dish is pot-au-feu. I put water in the pot, and the chopped vegetables...
And then... I saw that!

On the underside of a big leaf, on the whole surface, a bunch of tiny insect eggs packed together...!

Wendy & Yurii:
AAAAGGGHHH!! YUUUCK!

[And then, after calming the riotous Wendy and Yurii, they went to sleep giving up dinner.]

Innkeeper:
Please do come again.

(exit town and go through southwest cave)

Rukias:
We've reached the other side of the tunnel...

Wendy:
......

Yurii:
...Wendy?

Wendy:
...Oh.
What's the matter?

Yurii:
Uhh, just now...

Wendy:
...Now? What?

Yurii:
No, it is nothing.

Wendy:
..Oh? Strange Yurii...

Felmentia is over here, huh?

Yurii:
Just now Wendy had a painful face expression... Were my eyes mistaken?

1) She did look sad (*)
2) You saw incorrectly
3) Don't probe into it

Yurii:
I knew it, that must be so. But, I feel that we shouldn't interfere...

(approach Pothrads)

Pothrad:
What is it, you still haven't talked enough?
Hm, you seem different from the ones before.

Wendy:
Before? Who was here before?

Pothrad:
Ah. They asked a lot about the Dragon Orb.

Wendy:
Dragon Orb!
Please also tell us about the Dragon Orb.

Pothrad:
My my, again? Well, fine...
The Dragon Orb which you call a treasure manipulates the Dragon Vein flowing in the land. It's something that gathers planet's energy.
You people who plant those trees and look for the Dragon Orb, just what are you scheming?

Sales Staff:
We deal with products for the sake of improving life.
Pollumine makes the land active.

Pothrad:
Makes the land active? That is incorrect.
For an example, if you further delve for the scarce remaining water in a dried up well, you're unreasonably trying to draw it.
If you gather the planet's energy unreasonably, then the planet itself will probably become extinct.

Yurii:
That woman a while ago was saying the same thing.

Wendy:
Then perhaps what the Resistance is saying is correct...?

1) An unexpected coincidence
2) Perhaps they are right (*)
3) They are wrong
4) Can't say anything

Wendy:
Right... If that's so, then what we've been doing is...

Sales Staff:
At any rate, about where is Felmentia?

Pothrad:
If you mean a human city, then keep going south.
Well then, shall we return to our Pothrads' home?

(keep going south and reach Felmentia)

Yurii:
You must be tired. This is capital of Cyriltia kingdom, Felmentia.

Sales Staff:
Well then, time to work.

Wendy:
We need to meet with Sir Shuweizer. We'll need to ask instructions on our next action.

Rukias:
I am an outsider so it's probably better I don't go. I'll wait here.

(enter inn and talk to fairy)

Nina:
...Yurii...

Yurii:
What is wrong, Nina?

Nina:
...Sherris... was killed by that monster Ziekwalt...

Yurii:
Because history has changed, your partner has also...

Nina:
We fairies accept the time as it is and deal with the change of the reality...
But, only ones who have not lost their important person can say that.
To suddenly have that important person disappear... I can't take it at all...

(go to the castle)

Wendy:
We have now arrived.

Shuweizer:
You are late.

Wendy:
How are the business negotiations?

Shuweizer:
It's as you see. The Pothrads are opposing it.
Apparently even in this country, the Pothrads have a lot of say.
...What a bother.

Wendy:
Ah, Sir Shuweizer, where are you going?

Shuweizer:
There's somewhere I have to go. It's to put business discussions in order...

Wendy:
Huh?

Shuweizer:
Hey, you, come with me!

Monopolis Soldier:
Yes sir!

Wendy:
What could they be doing?

(approach the group)

Sales Staff:
Therefore, this tree also has the effect of keeping Screapers away...

Pothrad:
And that's why we keep saying it! We can't burden the land's power!

Sales Staff:
But we've been planting these trees up to now, and there hasn't been any burden on the land...

Pothrad:
Humans cannot see it! But we Pothrads, together with the land...

Yurii:
Eh, this was...

Sales Staff:
Then, we shall transport 1000 tree seedlings immediately.

General Graff:
Yes, we're counting on you.

Rukias:
Hey, what was that just now? It felt the same as the other day!

Wendy:
This time the Pothrad's disappeared... This... and that time...
Yurii!?

Yurii:
It is serious! Please hurry, everyone!

Wendy:
Uh, to where?

Yurii:
North... to where the Pothrads live!
First please hurry to the place where we met Pothrads on the way here!

(rest at inn)

Rukias:
... Uhh... ugh...
...uh...damn...
Lera... run... Lera!
...uhh...Agh...!
...Lera, Lera!

Yurii:
That was Rukias' voice just now...
It seems he's having a nightmare.

Rukias:
...Huu..

Yurii:
Rukias, what is the matter?

Rukias:
...It's nothing...

Wendy:
Wait a minute, Rukias. you know something is wrong, but it's not good to talk that way, you know?

Rukias:
......

1) Defend Rukias (*)
2) Agree with Wendy
3) Stay silent

Wendy:
Huh! I'm the one that's wrong?

Rukias:
It's just that I had a bad dream.
I have it very night.
...Damn, it looks like I was deep in sleep.

Wendy:
Huh!?

Rukias:
Well, let's get going now.

(go to where you came out of the tunnel, then west. keep going west)

Yurii:
The barrier has disappeared... let us hurry!

(go into Pothrad village and walk to bridge)

Rukias:
Is it really this place? There's no one here.

Pothrad:
You people! Did you come to kill us again?!
I don't know! The Dragon Orb is not here!

Wendy:
Please calm down, we are not your enemy!
Just what happened?

Pothrad:
A human came about one month ago and suddenly killed my fellows.
They asked about the Dragon Orb, and finding out that it wasn't here, they killed the patriarch and others...

Wendy:
Dragon Orb... and killed the patriarch...?
Just who could have done it?

1) Terrorists
2) That Resistance woman
3) Shuweizer (*)
4) Don't know

Yurii:
Yes, that's correct.
Since you came to this continent, a person called Shuweizer has been changing history.

Wendy:
Sir Shuweizer did? That's unbelievable!
Furthermore, it was one month ago, and the barrier on this continent was still not broken!

Yurii:
However, it is true. That person changed history...

Rukias:
What's the meaning of that? How is it possible to change history?
...Wait...

Yurii:
Did you realize it?
At the time you came to this continent, there were supposed to be Queen Screapers flying in the sky.

Wendy:
Speaking of which, that time Shuweizer said he would do something...

Yurii:
I don't understand how, but somehow it seems he has the power to surpass time.
Using such a power he can change history to suit his own convenience...

Rukias:
Traveling is dangerous, so he made monsters disappear. And now he killed Pothrads because they were getting in his way.
Unexpectedly, it's probably his shady maneuvers behind the quick growth of Monopolis company...

1) I can't believe it
2) That's a possibility (*)
3) Remain silent

Wendy:
I see. It can't be denied.
But if he can freely change the past, then he would change the world according to the benefit for the company?

Yurii:
Changing the past is not a simple matter. Even among various limitations, the results of what is changed is the present.

Rukias:
So it doesn't particularly matter.
But if we leave him be then it could become very serious now.

Wendy:
Although it's serious, we can't do anything if he can change history!
Can we even go to the past?

Yurii:
To the past...

(go inside Pothrad house and talk to Pothrad)

Yurii:
Umm, there's one thing I want to ask, but how did the invaders penetrate the barrier that is supposed to be protecting this village?

Pothrad:
Ah, that barrier?
We hold a special gem in order to pass that barrier.
That lot killed our fellow who went outside to investigate, and stole that gem.

Wendy:
How terrible...

Pothrad:
Do you have any other business?

Merklich:
1) Shop
2) Rest
3) Save
4) Summon Yurii

(stock up on items, rest, and save. check the rotating glowing ball outside)

Yurii:
This is a time distortion...! If we use this...

Wendy:
What is it, Yurii?

Yurii:
Can you feel this distortion? This is a time distortion.
It seems it is tied to one month ago.

Rukias:
Isn't that the time that the Pothrads were killed?

Yurii:
Yes. That is right.

Rukias:
So he can really pass through time.
...Damn! If we could also pass through time...

Yurii:
It may be possible...
Since you people can feel the change of the flow of time, then maybe you can go back in time with this distortion.

Wendy:
Is such a thing possible?

Yurii:
I have not tried it before.
However, with a distortion this big, then with you all present and the power of a fairy...

Rukias:
If we can go to the past, then we can stop the massacre of the Pothrads.

Wendy:
Then, we have to fight Shuweizer?

Yurii:
If we could solve it by discussion, that would be desirable.
But, this much is certain.
There are no one else than you who can change history.

1) Wait until we have finished preparations
2) Immediately go back to the past (*)

Yurii:
Then, I shall send you to the time's whirl!

[Pothrad Village, 1 month ago]

Patriarch:
Who are you people? What did you come here for?

Shuweizer:
There are two matters.
The first is about the Dragon Orb. Is it true that it manipulates the power of the earth?

Patriarch:
It's true. Don't you know that it makes the Peace Maintenance Army's Admonisher float?

Shuweizer:
Unfortunately, we are from a different world.
So then, where is that Dragon Orb?

Patriarch:
Ziekwalt is supposed to have it. Any more than that, I don't know!

Shuweizer:
Then where is Ziekwalt?

Patriarch:
He destroyed the Queen Screaper at Kaiseris and died. I do not know more than that.

Shuweizer:
I see.
Then I will move to the second matter.

Patriarch:
What is it?

Shuweizer:
I will kill all of you!

Patriarch:
What!?

Rukias:
Hm? This is...

Shuweizer:
What!? Ridiculous, how did they pass through time?
Even if they can follow me, their own power of passing through time is...

Wendy:
Sir Shuweizer! Please stop it!

Shuweizer:
I don't know how you pursued me, but do not get in my way!
If only these creatures weren't there, we could succeed our negotiations!

1) It is not fine to kill people (*)
2) Lives are more important than business tradings
3) Use force to stop him
4) Remain silent

Shuweizer:
If you obstruct me, then I will also kill you!
You can die in a world where you're not originally supposed to be!

======================================
MISSION BATTLE 10 Defend Pothrad Village

======================================

Patriarch:
I don't know who you are, but you came to help us?
Please! Protect the Pothrads!
I have a few recovery medicines on hand, but only a few!

(Wendy attacks a soldier)
Wendy:
Stop it! They are innocent villagers!

Monopolis Soldier:
You stop getting in our way! It's Shuweizer's orders! Obey them!

(Rukias attacks a soldier)
Rukias:
This is a massacre! Don't you know that?!

Monopolis Soldier:
What are you!? Terrorist supporter?! Stay in your place!

(after a while)

Shuweizer:
I see... You intend to go against me to the last...
I don't know how you traveled through time, but that power is mine.
If you have the same ability, you will only be an obstacle to me! Die here!

(kill 5 soldiers)

Shuweizer:
Tch!
I can only access the same time span once, but to have things go like this is...!
Retreat!

(after battle)

Yurii:
You did it! You did well, everyone!

Wendy:
...We did it but, with this we can't be part of the company any more...

1) Agree
2) I have no attachment to that sort of company (*)
3) Do you have an attachment for a company that kills people?

Wendy:
......

Rukias:
What's the matter? You will have attachment to a company that would kill others for its own benefit?

Wendy:
That's not it!
That's not it, but... it's just...

Yurii:
I am sorry for interupting your talk.
I can't maintain the time more than this. We will return to the original time...

Rukias:
The Pothrads... We corrected the past?

Yurii:
Yes. With the battle in the past, you saved the Pothrads.

Wendy:
Shuweizer has such a power to change the past...
...Huh?
But, if that's so, if he went before we appeared, then he can overturn history again...

1) There is no worry about that (*)
2) Think the same thing as Wendy

Wendy:
Uh, how?

Rukias:
That man himself said it, didn't he? "I can only access the same time period once."

Yurii:
To make the impossible possible, there are quite a few restrictions.

Patriarch:
Ohh, you people are the ones who helped us from that villain.
That time suddenly ended and I couldn't say thanks.
Thank you very much.

Wendy:
Speaking of which, that time, you were saying about what happened to the Dragon Orb...

Patriarch:
Yes, I was asked about the whereabouts of the Dragon Orb. It was supposedly held by Ziekwalt.
However, he fought the Queen Screaper on Kaiseris Island and died.

Wendy:
Then, the Dragon Orb must still be there?

Patriarch:
Probably so.

Rukias:
Hey, let's hurry to Kaiseris.
They're going to get the Dragon Orb.

1) Agree (*)
2) Deny
3) Remain silent

Wendy:
Yes! We can't let the Dragon Orb be abused!
That Resistance woman was saying "this planet will probably die".

Yurii:
I know where Kaiseris Island is.

(exit Pothrad village)

Yurii:
Kaiseris Island is near where we first met Rukias. Let's head to the desert town Zaramba.
From here, I think it would be faster to to go through Cyriltia south of here.

(go south and reach the area in front of Felmentia)

Yurii:
Please head east to go toward Kaiseris Island.

(go east two screens. approach the group of people)

Yurii:
It looks like the road to the Peace Maintenance Brigade is blocked.

Wendy:
Ahead of there is the Peace Maintenance Brigade? Uhh.. and that Admonisher?

Yurii:
Yes. Immediately east of here is the PMB headquarters.
And from the Admonisher in the sky, they keep an eye on the countries of the continent.
But since the Dragon Orb was lost and the Admonisher isn't active, it has descended on land.

Wendy:
So if it had the Dragon Orb, it could rise again...

Rukias:
Anyway, we're going to Kaiseris Island now, right? If we don't hurry then those Monopolis guys will steal it.

Yurii:
That is right. To to go Kaiseris, please head south from here.

(the merchant sells items and allows you to save)

(go south 2 screens)

Yurii:
East of here is the area before Warslee village.

Wendy:
Uh, Warslee was certainly...

Yurii:
It is the village with the beach where I met you.

(if you sleep at inn at Warslee)

Rukias:
...ugh... ugh...

Yurii:
It looks like he's having a nightmare again. Poor Rukias...

(enter Zaramba)

Clerk:
You there sir! We have procured new weapons and armor! Please do take a look!

(if sleep again at Zaramba)

Rukias:
...ugh... ugh...

Yurii:
...Rukias looks like he's in terrible pain...

(go north to the rock path to Kaiseris)

Rukias:
A path inside the ocean water...

Yurii:
It looks like it's ebb tide.

(enter dungeon and use the warps on the ground to get to outside)

[There is a magic circle for transferring.
Will you use the magic circle?]
1) Yes (*)
2) No

Monopolis Soldier:
Sir Shuweizer, it's here! The sensor is shaking!

Shuweizer:
Ho, so this is the Dragon Orb...
I see, a great magical power. This must be the thing my old man is looking for.
If we have this, then we can activate the Admonisher, right?

All right, let's return.

Rukias:
Leave the Dragon Orb there!

Shuweizer:
Tch! They've sniffed us out here?

Monopolis Soldier:
Sir Shuweizer, we will hold them here! Please go ahead!

Shuweizer:
I'm counting on you!

Rukias:
He's running away?!

Shuweizer:
Goodbye!

Yurii:
Ah, he got away!

(approach healers)

Monopolis Soldier:
Did you see?! Our healing skill!

Yurii:
The enemy has few numbers but, but two healers are supporting them! Please be careful!

(after a while)

[The magic field glowed for an instant, but became quiet.]

Yurii:
? What is that?

Rukias:
What! Monsters appeared from there!

Yurii:
They are magical creatures! They came after human's traces.

Monopolis Soldier:
Tch! In an situation like this!

(defeat the soldiers)

+Obtained Artifact Sensor!+

(after battle)

Yurii:
He talked about activating the Admonisher. If that is put to evil use...

Wendy:
Let's go after him quickly!

(go back through the warps and exit Kaiseris Island)

Shuweizer:
Hey, get out of my way!

Woman:
I will not! The Dragon Orb is too much for human's hands! Please return it!

Shuweizer:
You are going to use it for your own purposes, right?

Woman:
We will not do such a thing! We are going to save this planet...

Shuweizer:
Shut up!

Wendy:
That is..!

Shuweizer:
Tch!

Woman:
Wait!

Wendy:
She's the...

Rukias:
......
Hey, you!
......nothing...
...Tch! You don't have memories...

(go southwest, west 2 maps)

Wendy:
That was the Admonisher?

Yurii:
Yes. But, where is it going?

Rukias:
Considering the direction, it's going toward Hingistan Kingdom.
Aren't there any Transgates left in this continent?

Yurii:
They are not used by humans now, but the ones who know about them are Pothrads...

Wendy:
Then, we have to go to the Pothrad village, right?

(go north toward PMB, west toward Felmentia, and north to Pothrad village. talk to Patriarch)

Patriarch:
Thank you for helping us, humans. If there's anything we can help you with, feel free to ask.

Wendy:
Umm, do you know of the device called "Transgate"?

Patriarch:
Transgate? West of the village is that device.
There's someone who knows about it more than I do.
If you talk to that person you'll certainly learn more.

Wendy:
Thank you very much.

(exit the village west)

Wendy:
I wonder what's ahead of here?

Pothrad:
There should be a Transgate facility, which was used 2000 years ago. It used to link all of the place around the world.

Wendy:
The Transgate! If we can use that, we can return to our continent.

Pothrad:
That was 2000 years ago. It's probably broken.

Wendy:
We have to use it to chase the Admonisher! Let's try checking it out!

Pothrad:
Then you should remember these words: "attach the light and pass the door".

Rukias:
Attach the light...? I wonder what that means.

(go west to the big door)

Wendy:
The Trangate is inside here. I wonder if we can really use it?

(enter and go upstairs)

Rukias:
That reminds me, the Pothrad said something.

1) Change the light to open the door
2) Attach the light to go past the door (*)
3) Bend the light to shut the door

Yurii:
Yes, he certainly said that.

Rukias:
What could "attach the light" mean?

(put a character next to each green door and 1 character near the green light orb an wall)

[The light in the orb has been absorbed by Rukias.]

"The light dislikes fighting... Do not ever let your heart be disturbed..."

(move the character with light to both of the doors)

[The light has disappeared.]

(go upstairs and absorb a light again)

Yurii:
Monsters have appeared! Please be careful!

(you must do the same thing except with two lights and respawning monsters. when doors opened go downstairs twice and check the magic circle on the ground)

Wendy:
There's a response in the artifact sensor.
It's small so it doesn't seem to be this thing.

Rukias:
That should be the Transgate.
...If we fix it, maybe we can use it.

(open the left door)

[Unlocked the door!]

(exit, return to Pothrad village and talk to the Pothrad who told you about the Transgate)

Pothrad:
What? You opened that room?
I'm very interested in what it has become inside there.
Shall I go see?

(go back inside the Transgate center and find the Pothrad)

Pothrad:
Just as I thought it can't be used right now.
Hm? What's that noise?

Wendy:
It's an artifact sensor we have.
Anyway, can this be repaired?

Pothrad:
I don't have parts on hand.
But I think I can fix it using the parts of that sensor you have. What will we do?

Wendy:
That reminds me, it dropped from the enemy at the previous battle.

(select アーティファクトセンサ)

Pothrad:
This will be good. All right, I'll repair it right away!

(exit the building)

Rukias:
I have a few things I want to ask you.
Right now we're going to Esgrentz continent to pursue the Admonisher.
But after we reach it, what do you intend to do?

1) Prevent it from being used for evil intentions
2) Get it back for the Peace Maintenance Brigade (*)
3) Destroy it
4) Take away the Dragon Orb
5) Haven't thought of it before

Wendy:
Though they are few, the Peace Maintenance Brigade people protect peace. Because of that, the best thing would be to return it to them.

Rukias:
I see. At the least, it looks like you don't intend to abuse the Dragon Orb.

Wendy:
Why of course!
So then, is there anything else?

Rukias:
I came to this continent to search for the Dragon Orb.

Wendy:
Huh? For what?

Rukias:
To explain that, there are people I want to meet after we return to that continent.
And after you meet him, Merklich, your memories may return.

(go back inside and talk to Pothrad)

Pothrad:
...All right, the adjustment is complete.
There is response from the other side. It's possible to transfer any time.

(use Transgate)

[Will you use the Transgate?]
1) Yes (*)
2) No

Rukias:
We've arrived safely.

Yurii:
Where is this place?

Wendy:
Yes, let's look at the map to confirm.

(look at map, 大陸地図)

Wendy:
This response is the inside of Hingistan Kingdom. Looks like we really made it.

Rukias:
However, this area is controlled by Fomeros army, right?
...Leystan area, huh? This is good.

Wendy:
Good?

Rukias:
The person I want you to meet is here.

(defeat monsters. step on the save point)

Yurii:
This is a recording magic from ancient times.
There are many of these magic circles in the dungeons in my continent.
Stand in the center and check the magic circle and you can record.

(go downstairs twice)

[Warning
Warning. Currently, due to the over-consumption of energy, the grond floor's energy source has become unstable. To use the ground foor, please decrease energy cosumption by changing the floor's switch.

(check the pillar-like thing in bottom left)

Rukias:
It looks like we can pass power through here.
By using the switches correctly, power will flow into here.

(check the lever in center of room)

Wendy:
If we pull this lever it should switch the energy?

[There are 2 lamps...
There are 3 lamps...
There are 3 lamps...
It is a condenser that will transfer power to the above floor.
There are 4 lamps...
There is 1 lamp...
There are 4 lamps...
It looks like a power generator.]

Yurii:
There is no response...

(check the lever at top center with two lamps)

Yurii:
This is...

Wendy:
The lamps went out... Looks like it cut power to those.
The lamps lighted...the power was moved there.
Apparently, the power only flows in the arrows' direction on those wirings

[Regular power has been secured.]

(go upstairs)

Rukias:
Looks like the barrier wall to the generator has opened.
Let's try using the switches to this generator.

(pull the top right switch in middle of floor, the west room with 2 lamps, and the switch by the generator)

[Regular power has been secured. Main gate's lock will release.]

(go upstairs and exit bottom left)

Rukias:
Ahh, we finally got out.

(go east)

Man:
Damn, how many are there?

Merchant:
It's no good, Hofman! The escort other than you has been done in...

Hofman:
It's no good to give up!
Reinforcements will come soon, right?

Terrorist:
That man is pretty strong... But, this is his last breath.

Rukias:
...Hm...? I smell blood.

Yurii:
Ah, over there!

Wendy:
A caravan is being attacked? Let's help them!

======================================

Aren't you robbing?! You think you can do such thing?!

Steed:

Ack, the bridle! The steed will run away!
Please, make it return to me!

Steed:

Yurii:
Please calm down, it's all right...

[The Steed calmed down!]

(if Hofman is heavily damaged)

Hofman:
This is bad!

(after battle)

Hofman:
Thank you for helping me.

Fomeros Soldier:
The battle point is still ahead?

Man:
We're almost there!
Ah, over there!

Fomeros Soldier:
Uh, there?!

Hofman:
I'm in trouble...
Captain, I will go ahead to the city.

Merchant:
Ah, Hofman!

Fomeros:
That was Hofman...?
No, the priority is to the matter here.

Are you all right, everyone?

Merchant:
Yes, those people passing by helped us.

Fomeros Soldier:
I see. Thank you, you guys.
The city is near. We shall escort you.

(talk to soldier)

Fomeros Soldier:
Thank you for protecting the merchants from the terrorists!

1) Reply (*)
2) Remain silent

Fomeros Soldier:
The terrorists are hiding around here. We were careless.
Was there anything particular?

Wendy:
I'm sorry, we are a little...
Anyway, what are the terrorists doing lately?

Fomeros Soldier:
The terrorist actions have decreased remarkably. It seems the organization that controlled them has gone.
When you come up to here, that it's not terrorists any more, it's the antigovernment organization... the Resistance.

Wendy:
Resistance...

Fomeros Soldier:
It's still only rumor, but there is someone called very charismatic there...
Therefore, the attack just now could possibly just be bandits pretending to be terrorists.
At any rate, please be careful if you are traveling.

(go east and enter Leystan)

Wendy:
Hingistan Kingdom, north city Leystan, huh? But, no matter what it looks like, it's Fomeros country.

Rukias:
So now Fomeros army is stationed here.

Yurii:
Umm, if possible, can you tell me about this continent's current situation?

1) Tell her (*)
2) It's not necessary
3) Remain silent

Yurii:
Thank you.

Wendy:
This is Hingistan's city called Leystan. A few years ago an internal struggle occured within Hingistan.
That struggle itself was immediately suppressed, but people who are aiming for revolution continue resisting underground.
It gradually progressed into a radical direction, and became terrorism. The neighboring country Fomeros couldn't stand to see it, and dispatched soldiers to restore order.

Yurii:
A different country's soldiers?

Rukias:
They call it for the sake of restoring order, but they actually want this country's mine resources.
The proof of that is from the fact that they remain in Jiant Mountain south of here even after terrorists are gone.

Wendy:
Leystan is also like that since only Fomeros soldiers are here.
Because of that it looks like damage from terrorists has been extinguished.

Yurii:
I see...

(enter inn and talk to Hofman)

Hofman:
Ah, you guys. Thank you for your help a while ago.
So you weren't together with the Fomeros soldiers?

Wendy:
Yeah.

Are you being pursued by the Fomeros army?

Hofman:
What, what could this be about?
Well it looks like it has already leaked out.
But please believe me. I'm innocent.
So I can't get caught now.

1) Believe him (*)
2) Don't believe him
3) There is no need to flee if you are innocent
4) Ask for proof to his innocence

Hofman:
Thank you. If only the Fomeros army would believe me too...

(rest at inn)

Innkeeper:
Then I shall guide you to your rooms.

Rukias:
Then, go ahead. I will go call that person I mentioned.

Rukias:
I kept you waiting.

Sir, it's him...

Old man:
Ohh, that face! Those tattoos are no doubt...!

Rukias:
I knew it.

As I told you before, it seems he lost his memory.
I want you to tell him.

Old man:
Lost memories...

Rukias:
I thought it was strange he was working as Monopolis' private soldier.

Old man:
Hmmm.
First shall I have you explain the the circumstances?

Wendy:
Then, I will...

Old man:
...I see...

Wendy:
So then, what about him?

Old man:
The marks on his face are unmistakeable. He is the one who protects the great land's Shrine Maiden, the Brave Guard.

Yurii:
Brave Guard...

Old man:
The Brave Guard wakes one by one and protects the Shrine Maiden by himself.
It was decided 2000 years ago since sealing the invader.

Wendy:
Protect the Shrine Maiden from the invaders 2000 years ago... Just what happened 2000 years ago?

Old man:
According to our passed down legend, the invader Infinitor appeared from the sky in a large ship, and began to take the power of this planet's land.
The planet's power began to weaken, and it was obvious that it would be destroyed if it kept going. The people stood up to fight against the Infinitor.
At that time, the Shrine Maiden used the Dragon Orb, which is the planet's crystallization, to seal the Infinitor's soul.

Wendy:
It's an extraordinary story...
So then, where was that soul sealed?

Old man:
The place where the great Infinitor's soul was sealed is no other than the planet's crystallization, the Dragon Orb.

Yurii:
Inside the Dragon Orb the Infinitor's soul is...

Old man:
And so since that sealing, once in every 200 years the great land''s Shrine Maiden will go to Goatland and strengthen the seal on the Dragon Orb.
The Brave Guard is to stake his life to protect the Shrine Maiden until her duty is done.
In spite of that, the maiden is...

Rukias:
You saw it. That woman who is acting together with the Resistance.
That is the great land's Shrine Maiden.

Wendy:
That person who was with Land's Prayer? What does that mean?

Old man:
It was five years ago...
One night, the Shrine Maiden and the Brave Guard suddenly vanished from the village. The reason is unknown.
But on the next day, Monopolis private soldiers attacked and killed everyone in the village.

Wendy:
Monopolis did!? Is that true?

Old man:
One of them was seen. There's no mistake.
I took this child who was still young and somehow escaped...

Rukias:
The great land's Shrine Maiden disappeared right before the attack, and now acts with the Resistance. Just what is she thinking...?
But soon the cycle of 200 years will come. It's when the seal must be strengthened.
We have to do something as long as she doesn't.
That's why I went to Goatland when the seal released to look for the Dragon Orb.

Wendy:
Inside the Dragon Orb an invader was sealed 2000 years ago... It seems unbelievable, I don't know what to think.

Old man:
According to the legend, it is so.
Even if you destroy the Infinitor's body, it will move to another and possess it, so it can't be destroyed.
So its soul was sealed inside the Dragon Orb which is a crystallization of this planet.
But it is difficult to keep the powerful invader's soul sealed, so every 200 years the Shrine Maiden must strengthen the seal's power.

Wendy:
But Goatland had been covered by a barrier, right? They can't enter it, can they?

Old man:
Ordinary people cannot. But there were "barrier breaking rings" in the village.

Rukias:
When Monopolis soldiers attacked it, it seems all of those weren't stolen.
Whichever, it's not needed any more now that the seal has broken.

Yurii:
I have a question then, but if the seal on the Dragon Orb were to break, what would happen?

Old man:
The disaster of 2000 years ago will probably repeat.

Wendy:
I wonder if Monopolis knows this?

Old man:
I don't know if they know this much. In the first place, I don't even know their objective in attacking the village.

Yurii:
Either way, it would be terrible if we don't get the Dragon Orb back before its seal breaks.
But, if they know about that, then just what is their objective...?

Rukias:
In any case, it doesn't change the fact that we have to take the Dragon Orb from them.
Isn't that so?

1) We will get back the Dragon Orb (*)
2) There's no need to get it back
3) I can't believe what was just said

Wendy:
That's right!

Old man:
If you are the Brave Guard, then you must have power. I'm counting on you!

Wendy:
The problem is, where is the Admonisher heading...
Do you have an idea where it is?

Old man:
Recently Monopolis' interest has been toward Jiant Mountain.

Rukias:
Jiant Mountain? That's where the Fomeros army is staying, isn't it?

Old man:
Although it's not because it's a mine, for some reason Hingistan army has become desperate to take it back.
So Monopolis has also noticed that activity there.

Wendy:
No way... the giant...?

Yurii:
What's the matter?

Wendy:
It's something I've heard... In the ruins of Jiant Mountain, a giant is sleeping.
Its power can instantly turn a city to ashes...

Yurii:
It's much like the Admonisher...

Rukias:
How did you know such a thing? If you're a Hingistan citizen, then not anyone is supposed to know it, right?

Wendy:
That... I heard it from my mother, who worked in the Hingistan castle...

Rukias:
I see. At any rate, with no other clues we'll just have to try going there.

Old man:
Do your best.

Rukias:
So then, won't we have free time today?

Wendy:
Then, I'm going out for a bit!

(exit inn and talk to man near inn)

Man:
A while ago a gigantic globe object was flying in Jiant Mountain's direction.
Exactly what was that? A new Monopolis invention?

(talk to Rukias)

Rukias: So you are the real Brave Guard after all.

1) It seems so (*)
2) This must be some sort of mistake
3) Remain silent

Rukias:
Does it seem like I'm talking about another person's matter?
By watching you fight, I can see it well. Even though you've lost your memory, that strength is real.
However, your current strength doesn't seem to be up to what I've heard.

1) Prompt him to continue his story (*)
2) Remain silent

Rukias:
I want to become strong. When I was small I wanted to become the Brave Guard I heard about.
Therefore I will start by surpassing you!

1) You can't surpass me 2) What will you surpass in? (*)
3) It can easily be done

Rukias:
What I mean? Power. Power!
If I had power like the Brave Guard that time...

At any rate, I'm going to get stronger than you!
When I surpass you, then next is a stronger one. When that is done, than an even stronger one...
I'm going to get stronger no matter what.

1) I'll root for you (*)
2) It's impossible
3) Ask him why

Rukias:
Even though I'm saying I'd surpass him... What a strange guy...

Yurii:
He really wants to become strong.

(talk to Wendy)

Wendy:
As expected, it's better on the land you're used to.

Yurii:
From the conversation a while ago, Wendy is from this country?

Wendy:
Yes, that's right.
On that continent, we had Yurii tell us a lot of things, but here I will tell you a lot of things.

Yurii:
Thank you very much, Wendy.
......
I see... That's right...

Wendy:
What's the matter, Yurii?

Yurii:
Ah, no, it's nothing.
I just realized that we've come to a different continent.
More importantly, is the Admonisher really heading toward Jiant Mountain?

Wendy:
We can't say for sure, but I think the possibility is high.
Well, when the Admonisher arrives, then we'll know it's awful.
We'll have to endure until then!

(rest at inn, and exit inn)

Yurii:
Aaghh!

Wendy:
What's the matter, Yurii?

Yurii:
Now, the future...

Wendy:
What happened with the future?

Yurii:
I saw it. The Admonisher's blast, many soldiers, instantly...!
At least two countries' troops on the mountainside...

Wendy:
Jiant Mountain where both Hingistan and Fomeros armies are? It was fired there?

Yurii:
Sir Hero! We have to do something!

Wendy:
Hey, when is that?

Yurii:
This image is... tomorrow evening!

Rukias:
But, how will we prevent the cannon?
It's in the sky, isn't it?

1) Think of a way to enter the Admonisher
2) Impossible to prevent it from happening
3) Make the two armies retreat (*)
4) Remain silent

Wendy:
Yes, we can only do that.

Rukias:
But how?

Wendy:
Leave the Hingistan army to me! I will definitely make them retreat!
You guys please take the Fomeros side!

Yurii:
Wendy!

Wendy:
When we finish, we'll meet in this city!

Rukias:
It looks like she has an idea.
More importantly, how will we do the Fomeros side? We don't know anyone from Fomeros.

Yurii:
We must find someone who knows a lot about Fomeros.

(go inside inn and talk to Hofman)

Hofman:
Why is Hingistan army persisting in that mountain?
Fomeros army should be aiming at the mine mountain further ahead.

Rukias:
Hey, how do you know so much about Fomeros army?

Hofman:
It's because I'm a soldier of Fomeros.

Rukias:
Why is a Fomeros soldier being pursued?

Hofman:
It was put on by a superior. But I fully know the reason.

Rukias:
That is?

Hofman:
The presidential election is soon being held in Fomeros. There is the president running for re-election, and the opposing candidate, my elder brother.
In short, because of my error my brother got involved in scandal.

Rukias:
So you were caught in a trap. And now the superior who put you in the trap wants to prove it to  the president, right?

Hofman:
That's right. Therefore they want to arrest me alive.
Is there anything else you want to ask?

1) Tell him about the firing by the Admonisher (*)
2) Ask for a way to make the Fomeros army retreat
3) Nothing

Hofman:
What? Tomorrow evening with such a weapon!?
Is that true?

Rukias:
We can't say the details, but there's no mistaking that cannon is there.

Yurii:
So we want to make the armies retreat from the mountain somehow.
If you know about Fomeros army, then we think you know a good way.

Hofman:
Ordinarily, there's not.

Yurii:
Ordinarily?

Hofman:
The commander on that mountain is the man who set me up. Therefore, if I am bait, then he'd probably send soldiers to capture me.
But, it's impossible to do that because the confronting Hingistan army is there.

Rukias:
If that's it, it's being dealt with. Our friend is enacting a way to make the Hingistan army retreat.

Hofman:
Understood. Please come with me to the Fomeros army camp.
I am Lieutenant Hofman of Fomeros army. Nice to meet you.

[Hofman became an ally!]

(exit city)

Hofman:
Jiant Mountain is south of this lake and around it west.

(go south 2 maps)

Rukias:
Hmm...

Hofman:
Hmm? What's the matter?

Rukias:
You're really tall, right?

Hofman:
Ahahaha, I often hear people tell me "large udo tree".

Rukias:
Isn't that so? Seeing the body build you'll know how strong the person is.

Hofman:
Is that so... huh...
So then? What about it?

Rukias:
What did you do to become that big?

Hofman:
What did I do... hmmm...

Rukias:
Please, tell me!

Hofman:
There was a saying... "raise the sleeping child", I think?

Rukias:
"Sleeping child"...?  ...If it's sleeping, it will grow...?

1) That's right
2) It's not that
3) You won't grow if you only sleep (*)

Hofman:
Yes, that's right.

Rukias:
What do you mean?

Hofman:
Play well, eat well, sleep well. This is the secret to growing.
The body grows while it's sleeping. And growing is the body making up for something it lacks.
If your height doesn't reach, your height will extend. If you're not strong enough, muscles will form...
For your body to grow further then you'll have to use it where you want it to grow. And most of all, nutrition is necessary for growing. You know that it's no good if you don't eat, right?

Rukias:
You became big by doing those?

Hofman:
When I was a child I was mischievous.
I have an older brother, so we liked to compete.
From a brother I had a rivalry.
I wouldn't lose to him, so I did various crazy things.

Rukias:
Brothers, huh... I don't have any brothers...
However I understand your explanation somehow.
You want to win at what you do! ...Right?

Hofman:
Yes.

Rukias:
If that's so then it should be easy. I'm going to keep training like I am!

All right! I'll do it!

Yurii:
Humans become big by doing that? This is the first time I've heard it.

Hofman:
Well, that's just what I think.

Yurii:
Huh? Then were those lies?

Hofman:
No no, they're not lies. It's just the fact of what I personally experienced.

Yurii:
......Haa...
But, if Rukias' worry disappeared, then isn't it good?

(go south)

Hofman:
Jiant Mountain is directly west of here.

(go west and north)

Hofman:
Ahead is Jiant Mountain.

Yurry:
I wonder if Wendy was successful in making the Hingistan troops withdraw?

1) Believe in her (*)
2) Uncertain

Rukias:
We'll find out if we go.

(go north)

Rukias:
So then, shall we hear the strategy?

Hofman:
This mountain is a mine and also a Hingistan fortress.
That is perhaps why they are particular about this mountain when its mine is scarce.
This mountain's commander Wellber is the perpetrator of my trap.
He's a supply troop officer, but concurrently commands the frontline base. He accused me of crime and was promoted.
Therefore if he sees me, he'll have me captured.

Yurii:
You intend to act as bait yourself?

Hofman:
I can't think of any other way.
At any rate, that officer will absolutely want to capture me. That is definite.
And from his nature, he would use full power to pursue me.

Rukias:
In summation, we'll go with you to the top of the fortress, and the enemy soldiers coming to stop you will descend the mountain full force. The lured Fomeros soldiers will part from the fortress and the damage will be decreased.

Hofman:
Yes, if it goes well, then I think they won't be shot by the blast.

Rukias:
Why is that?

1) There's no basis for that
2) It's pointless to shoot if there are very few soldiers (*)
3) I don't know

Hofman:
That's right!
Of course, to judge that is subjective so we can't say for sure.

Yurii:
Ah! Everyone, over there!

Yurii:
The Admonisher!

Hofman:
There's no time, let's hurry!

Rukias:
Hey, a while ago you said make the enemies go after you, but concretely how much damage should we do?

Hofman:
Considering this mountain's army force, between 15 and 35 people. If we pass 15 people, then they should judge us a threat and go after us full force.
But if we get more than 35 people involved, the fortress' defense will become short on staff. If they recognize that, they will cancel the pursuit.
Furthermore, at the battle on the mountaintop, we'll draw out Wellber and will have to do considerable damage.

Rukias:
Then, let's roughly calculate.
We can defeat up to 34 people. Within that we have to defeat 15 people to lure out Wellber at the mountaintop...
So then until we reach the top then we have to defeat less than 20 people.

Hofman:
I don't know accurately how many enemies we'll have to fight at the mountaintop, but that idea is the aim.
Also, please don't fight with Wellber.

Rukias:
Is that your revenge?

Hofman:
No, it's not. If the officer is killed, then the army will rearrange its conditions to defend itself. We do not want that.

Rukias:
That's the plan, Brave Guard. As long as you don't give specific instruction to us, we will fight as normal, so please give instruction after thinking well!

Hofman:
We will get to the point on the mountaintop as much as we can without doing damage.

Rukias:
Okay, let's go!

[[Clear Conditions
- Merklich reaches top of mountain

Game Over Conditions
- Death of Hofman
- Kill more than 35 Fomeros soldiers or kill more than 20 before reaching the mountain top
- All party members eliminated]]

Hofman:
These are not strong enemies here so they will not seriously pursue us and it can't be helped, but if possible, please keep the damage to a minimum.

(just run north 2 maps)

Hofman:
Please persevere here as much as you can. Eventually, Lieutenant Wellber will certainly come out.

Rukias:
When that guy appears, we can start retreating?

Hofman:
Yes!

Fomeros Army Captain:
Is that the traitor Hofman!?
Hey! Report it to Colonel Wellber!

Hofman:
Colonel? When did he become colonel?

Fomeros Army Captain:
Start the power builder! Don't let him escape at all costs!

Fomeros Soldier:
Understood!

[[Clear Conditions

Fomeros Soldier:
Start the power builder!

(if barrel explodes)

Rukias:
What's that?! Something exploded?

Hofman:
It's machine fuel. It doesn't matter if it's destroyed, but anyone near when it explodes will receive damage! Be careful!

(destroy the lift control device)

Yurii:
If we destroy that then we don't have to worry about it forestalling us.

Continue damaging until Wellber comes out!

(Wellber appears)

Wellber:
So you really showed up! Have you decided to turn yourself in quietly?

Hofman:
I am innocent! My brother and I oppose this war!

Therefore I would absolutely not do things like divert goods into illegal channels!

Wellber
We'll hear that in the courtroom!

Hofman:
I cannot appear in a court that has no justice!

Until I get the proof that you framed me, I never will!

Wellber:
Kuh!
Arrest him by all possible means!

Hofman:
Well then I will hurry and run. I will leave the rest to you!

[[Clear Conditions
- After Hofman escapes, have remaining members also escape

(make Hofman reach stairs down)

Hofman:
The plan was a success. You guys please hurry and run too!

Rukias:
Yeah. If we don't get out of here it'll be dangerous!

(make Rukias and Merklich reach the stairs to end mission)

Yurii:
Let's leave it like this and go!

(run to next map)

Wellber:
You still haven't caught him?!
I'll promote the person who captures them!

(reach exit)

Wellber:
All soldiers, pursue them! Don't let them escape!

Wellber:
What, what is that!?
Damn! Will we make it in time back to the mountain?
Hurry and return!

Yurii:
The Admonisher is at the mountain...
It looks like it didn't fire.

Rukias:
The Hingistan army is already gone. It looks like she did well.

Yurii:
Let's return to Leystan!

(go to Leystan)

Wendy:
Ah, welcome back! It looks like it went well.

Yurii:
Thanks to you people the cannon didn't fire.
...But, somehow, my uneasiness still isn't gone...

Wendy:
What is it? We were able to change the future, right?

Yurii:
It's...

Rukias:
Hey, look over there!

Yurii:
The Admonisher is taking the giant?

Rukias:
That direction is, Goatland?

Yurii:
What does Monopolis intend to do taking that giant?
For weapon power, the Admonisher must be better with its firepower and flying in the sky.

Rukias:
Not comparing to the Admonisher, just possessing a strong weapon like that is no small thing.
Rather, the problem is that the enemy will use such a weapon.

1) Agree
2) It's unknown why they did not bring it back to the company (*)
3) Remain silent

Wendy:
Uh, I was thinking that.
If it's just to steal an enemy's weapon, there should be no reason to bring it all the way to the sealed continent.

Yurii:
Then, they intend to use that giant on that continent?

Rukias:
It looks like it would be better to return there quickly.

(go to inn and talk to innkeeper)

Innkeeper:
Welcome.
I have a message addressed to you.

+Obtained Letter from Hofman!+

Innkeeper:
There you go.
So then, how may I help you?

(read Hofman's letter)
"The fact that you are reading this letter means that you must have escaped safely. Thanks to you my country's soldiers weren't shot by the cannon. What good news! After that, I returned straight to Leystan, but on the way I was found by soldiers, and I don't have time to wait for your return. Please forgive the fact that I could only leave you a letter. Thank you very much. I will hide myself for a little while. I think we will meet again somewhere. After we meet again, let me thank you properly. Until then, take care! ~Hofman~"

(go back to Transgate center and use Transgate to Goatland. go to Pothrad village to the bridge)
(anime cutscene)

Rukias:
Ugh, what was that!

Wendy:
What's the matter, Yurii?

Yurii:
Humans... many humans lives... instantly...

Wendy:
They were killed? It can't be, the Admonisher?!

Yurii:
Not just killed... more like total annihilation!

Wendy:
Annihilation...?

Rukias:
Ugh!

Wendy:
Where... just where is it!?

Rukias:
That blast was in the south direction. Pretty far south...

Wendy:
South is... Felmentia's direction.

(go to Felmentia)

Wendy:
It looks like this place is safe. I wonder if we were fearing too much?

Rukias:
Well, the soldiers look pretty flurried?

Cyriltia Army Captain:
What!? The small country alliance... is gone? Don't be ridiculous!

Cyriltia Soldier:
It's true! The land is gone!

Cyriltia Army Captain:
They used the stolen Admonisher?

Krious:
No, even the Admonisher doesn't have that much power.
It has to be something else, making something explode that was concealing an ancient energy.

Cyriltia Soldier:
We'll hear the details from Sir Randall after he returns from investigation...

Wendy:
The giant... was used as a bomb...

Rukias:
A bomb? What do you mean?

Wendy:
The giant is an ancient weapon, and it has powerful magic reactor than cannot be created with current technology.
That powerful magic reactor was set off!

Yurii:
Many people were victimized... It can't be forgiven!

Wendy:
Yes, We'll absolutely retaliate...

Yurii:
No, let's help them!

Rukias:
You say help them, but they're already...
...Could it be...?

Wendy:
Change the time?

Yurii:
Yes, that's right.
To do that we'll have to find a time distortion linked to that past, but I think it's worth doing.

Wendy:
But, is there positive proof we can?

Yurii:
When I just met you, you remember there were Queen Screapers flying in the sky?
In that history, the Admonisher was destroyed fighting the Queen, and was broken beyond repair.

Wendy:
So you're saying that if we return that time, then the Admonisher will be destroyed and can't be activated?

Yurii:
Yes. Therefore it can't be used to make the giant explode.

Wendy:
I see.
All right then, we'll find the time distortion!

Rukias:
But, is that something that can be found easily?

Yurii:
Strong thoughts of the past can make a distortion. But it is not something that will transport people to the past.

Wendy:
Then, what about the time with the Pothrads' village?

Yurii:
That was Shuweizer making a distortion to go to the past himself.

1) Let's search for the same thing
2) Think about what Shuweizer did (*)
3) Remain silent

Wendy:
Speaking of which, when we came here before, Shuweizer changed history.

Yurii:
In the original history, Korin's master of the Peace Maintenance Brigade defeated the Queen, but it wasn't completely destroyed, and the result was that the Queen multiplied.
That history changed, and Korin's master died before entering the PMB, and the Queen was defeated by Ziekwalt.
Korin's master's death was just before he entered the PMB. If we can go to the point when he was alive...

Wendy:
That place is?

Yurii:
Warslee village.
If we can save him there, history will return to normal.
However at the same time, the multiple Queen Screapers will be back.

Wendy:
We'll have to defeat those Queens?

Yurii:
That is nonsensical talk!
To defeat just one Queen, the Admonisher itself crashed into it, and the weakened Queen was at last defeated with a struggle.
Attacking it using the wrong way may cause it to multiply, if that happens again...

1) It's impossible for us to defeat it
2) Investigate the way Ziekwalt did it (*)

Wendy:
That's right. Ziekwalt defeated the Queen, right?
Then wouldn't it be better to find that out first?

Rukias:
Let's find a person who knows a lot about Ziekwalt.

(talk to Krous)

Krious:
Hey, you guys are the ones I met before the harbor.

Wendy:
Hello, it's been a while. If I remember gith that time, you talked about a person named Ziekwalt...

Krious:
Yeah, but in the end Ziekwalt and the Queen killed each other.

Wendy:
That's what we heard, but we are also interested in Ziekwalt.

Krious:
What do you want to know?

1) Is there anyone who knows more about Ziekwalt? (*)
2) Who is Ziekwalt?
3) Nothing

Krious:
Someone who knows about Ziekwalt...
That reminds me, at the time I met Ziekwalt before, he was going to the Pothrads' dwelling.

Yurii:
So it seems that the Pothrad patriarch must know about Ziekwalt.

Wendy:
So then, it would be better to go to the Pothrad village.
Thank you very much!

Krious:
It's quite all right.

(exit Felmentia and approach the merchant)

Merchant:
Ah, you there!
It's an abrupt question, but do you know where the Pothrad village is?

Merklich:
1) Yes, I know (*)
2) No, I don't

Merchant:
Ohh! You know!
Then, I have a request. Please take me there!

Merklich:
1) Yes (*)
2) No

Merchant:
Ohh, thank you so much!
What I'm going to do will surely be helpful to you!
Well then, I'm counting on you!

(go to Pothrad village while protecting the merchant)

Merchant:
Oohh! This is the Pothrad village!
Actually I was thinking of opening Steed Express.
Simply saying, it's a business to send customers to desired destinations for a fee.
With this there is no danger of traveling, and you can greatly save time!
Well then, I'll have to prepare opening my business right away!

(go inside big purple tent's right door and talk to Patriarch)

Wendy:
Sir Patriarch, there is something we'd like to ask.
How did Ziekwalt defeat the Queen Screaper without letting it multiply?

Patriarch:
He used the barrier. If the Queen is not defeated within a special barrier, then the scattered body pieces will regenerate.

Wendy:
Then to defeat the Queen we have to affix a barrier?

Patriarch:
That's right.

Yurii:
That means, if Korin's hero could put up a barrier and defeat the Queen Screaper in good timing, then it would be good...
...If we just had a time distortion where we could move to that point of timing...

Wendy:
Will you tell us how that barrier is made?

Patriarch:
I think there's no meaning in that in a world with no Queen Screaper, but... well, fine.
The barrier needs an absorption slab. If we just had materials, we can make it.

Wendy:
What are the materials?

Patriarch:
Most of the things are here, but we just don't have Niara powder.
Niara powder affects the airspace. It is indispensable for the absorption slab.

Yurii:
Is there none remaining?

Patriarch:
Unfortunately so.
Originally it was used 2000 years ago to enclose this land in a barrier.
At that time it was stored in a battleship, but now such things wouldn't be remaining...
More importantly, it would be quicker to search for ruins on this continent. If you find ingredients, I will make the slab.

Wendy:
It seems we should find a person knowledgeable about ruins on this continent.

1) Let's just start searching
2) Ask Yurii if she has an idea of who (*)
3) Remain silent

Yurii:
Let me see...
The historian in Cyriltia is called an expert on ruins investigation.

(use Steed Merchant in the inn to go to Felmentia 「フェルメンティア前」)

Cyriltia Army Captain:
We have troubled you, Sir Randall. Your expertise is history...

Randall:
The situation is the situation. If my knowledge of geology and ruins is helpful, please call me any time.
Well then, I'll excuse myself.

Cyriltia Army Captain:
Are you returning to Juwaina?

Randall:
I want to return right away, but I'm quite tired, so I will stay at the inn tonight.
Excuse me.

Yurii:
That person is...

(talk to captain)

Wendy:
Umm, about that person?

Cyriltia Army Captain:
He is Sir Randall the historian, but is something the matter?

Wendy:
A historian?

Cyriltia Army Captain:
Sir Randall studies history by traveling to the continent's ruins, and he's also knowledgeable about the small country alliance.
Lady Sherris is normally in charge, but last month she was killed by Ziekwalt...
At any rate, we had help from Randall.

Yurii:
He is knowledgeable about ruins, right?

Cyriltia Army Captain:
Yes, that is so, but what about it?

Yurii:
Nothing. Thank you very much.

(enter inn and talk to Randall)

Yurii:
Excuse us...

Randall:
Hm? Who are you?

Wendy:
You are the historian Sir Randall, right? Actually we came to ask something.

Randall:
What could it be? May I help you?

Wendy:
I'm sorry to be sudden, but we are looking for an ancient battleship.
You must know a lot about this continent's ruins, so do you have any idea?

Randall:
An ancient battleship?
But what do you intend to do with it when you find it?

Wendy:
I cannot say in detail, but we need it to save the people.
It's to also erase the tragedy of the small country alliance...

Randall:
That disaster is too harsh for words. We can never have that repeat again...

Wendy:
...Yes. So then, is there any place with an ancient battleship...

Randall:
Hmm.. ancient battleship, huh...
I don't want to tell ordinary people, but you have a fairy acting with you. More than anything, I see it in your eyes.
Those eyes have a light that pierces with justice.
Fine. I know of only one place...
...But...

Rukias:
...But?

Randall:
That battleship's interior is immersed. If you're going to search the inside of the ship, you will need to dive inside water.
Because we can't stay underwater long, that search is impossible.
You have no choice but to search for a way.

1) I know of one (*)
2) Can't think of anything

Yurry:
Oh, you do? Just what is it...

1) Pothrad village
2) Monopolis building (*)
3) Hingistan army base

Wendy:
Yes, that's it. It's certainly there.

Rukias:
The Monopolis data room, huh?

Wendy:
If it goes well, we can still enter it, I think.

Randall:
If so, then first bring it here.
It would be fine for me to guide you now, but it would become double effort.
I will wait here for you.

Wendy:
Thank you very much.

Rukias:
So then, first we'll go to Monopolis headquarters.

(take steed to Pothrad village　「ポトラドの里前」, go to Transgate center and the warp)

Rukias:
What will we do after we use this to get to the other continent?

Wendy:
A boat periodically goes from fishing village Schizarz to the headquarters.

Rukias:
It will take some time.

Pothrad:
Ohh, humans. I was just in time.
If you are going to the outside continent, I have something I to ask.

Wendy:
What is it?

Pothrad:
Until now, the Transgate which used the Dragon Vein was forbidden, but now that the seal has broken, the ban is lifted.

Wendy:
You'll also make Transgates on this continent?

Pothrad:
Transgates are not simple things, so it would take a few years.
At any rate if I don't investigate the Transgate's frequency, then I can't link the gates.
So then, using this, I want you to investigate the frequency of the outside gates.

+Obtained Gate Opener!+

Pothrad:
This device not only investigates the frequency, it will temporarily activate an inactive gate.

Wendy:
In short, if we have this then we can transfer from gates that are inactive?

Rukias:
That's very convenient for us.

Pothrad:
That is right, so please go around to many gates.

(go to Esgrentz and to the transgate by Leystan)

Yurii:
So this is a Transgate? It seems to be at a standstill.
If you use that Gate Opener then you can probably activate it.

(use ゲートオープナー on it. travel south until the 4-way crossroad, go east. do the same thing to the Transgate in bottom right. enter Schizarz and talk to the man at dock)

Captain:
The ship will depart tomorrow. Please wait until then.

Wendy:
It can't be helped. We'll have to kill time until tomorrow.

Rukias:
Okay. Then let's disperse.

Yurii:
Please don't go outside the village!

(approach Rukias)

Yurii:
I wonder why Rukias is so set on getting strength?
Because he's from the village of the great land he has to keep face?

1) Not interested in other people's matters
2) Try to ask him someday (*)
2) Tell Yurii to ask him

Yuri:
I see... We'll look for a suitable time and ask him personally.

(talk to Rukias)

Rukias:
It was good that we were able to save many soldiers on Jiant Mountain. It's thanks to your and Hofman's tact.
But Shuweizer is scheming something different. We have to get the Dragon Orb from him quickly.

(talk again)

Rukias:
I have to become stronger... Please don't disturb me.

(enter inn)

Yurii:
Oh? Where is Wendy? I thought she went into the inn...

(leave and enter inn again. talk to Wendy.)

Wendy:
Say, I did a little cooking, would you like to try it?

1) Yes (*)
2) No

Wendy:
All right, thank you.

Wendy:
Here it is...

[The cooking was not bad, but couldn't be called very delicious.]

Wendy:
How was it?

1) Give compliments (*)
2) It was bad and get angry
3) Remain silent

Wendy:
Thank you for your compliment.
But I want to know the true evaluation. If it was tasteless, say so.

Yurii:
No, I don't think it was tasteless at all.
It's just that there's no characteristic flavor, just a normal taste.

Wendy:
I see... No characteristic, huh...

Yurii:
Who did you learn cooking from?

Wendy:
Huh? Not particularly anyone...
Cooking is something you learn from someone? Then isn't it like stealing other people's cooking?

Yurii:
Certainly professional cooks do that. But ordinary people must learn from someone.
In general you learn from mothers, and pass on the family's taste.

Wendy:
Mother, huh? That's impossible...

Yurii:
Your mother is perhaps...

Wendy:
Ah, yes I have one. But she doesn't cook.
Cooking is not "what you do". It's "what you put out" and "entertainment".

Yurii:
Oh, a lady, hm?

Wendy:
It becomes so... Therefore I starting cooking after I entered Monopolis.

1) Then you are good at it (*)
2) Then you'd better work on it
3) You don't need to force yourself to do it

Wendy:
Oh, really? Those words will encourage me, and I'll try harder.

Well, I ended up taking much of your time.
Thank you for today. I'll count on you when I make something next time!

(rest the night and talk to the boat captain)

Captain:
You want to go to Monopolis headquarters? You may board, but do you have a return destination?

Yurii:
Yes, there is no need to worry about our return.

Captain:
Then go ahead and board. We will depart soon.

Yurii:
Will you board the boat immediately?

1) I still have things to do
2) We will board immediately (*)

(arrive in Makinus)

Yurii:
This is Monopolis? This is the first time I've seen such large buildings.

Wendy:
I wonder if you search the whole world you won't find buildings bigger than these?

Rukias:
Well then, what do we do from here?

Wendy:
If we can still use our ID cards, then we can just go in and fetch it, but Rukias doesn't have one.

Rukias:
Then I'll wait here.

Yurii:
I'll probably stand out. I'll stay with Rukias.

(enter headquarters)

Wendy:
If we talk carelessly then we'll be found out. We'll have to act with caution.

(take elevator to 8F, enter data room and check the rightmost display)

[Small-model diving tool
Successfully tested product
A compressed gas cylinder 40 cm long, by connecting left and right, diving underwater for about 20 minutes is possible. Developed for saving lives on boats.]

Wendy:
This is it!

+Obtained Small Model Diving Tool+

Wendy:
Okay, let's get out of here without being seen.

(go to elevator)

Wendy:
Oh, excuse us.

Shayer:
Ah, it's you two...

Brandole:
What is it, who are they?

Wendy:
Commander, we're subordinates of Sir Shuweizer.

Brandole:
Shuweizer's... So you're members of the Red Wolves?
Do work hard to aid him.

Wendy:
Yes sir!

Shayer:
All right then, commander, the meeting will soon start.

Brandole:
Mmhm.

Wendy:
Commander Brandole who controls all of Monopolis company... this is the first time I ever saw him this close.
More importantly, let's get out of here before we're found out!

(exit building and talk to Rukias)

Rukias:
Looks like you've brought it out.
Well then,　let's hurry back to the other continent.

(exit Makinus and activate Transgate outside and use it)

[How to use Transgate
After activating a Transgate, it can be used to transfer to other activated Transgates. Two or more gates will need to be released in order to do so. Please select the destination with CIRCLE.]

(select Leystan 「都市レイスタン」 go to Transgate center, go to Goatland and to Felmentia 「フェルメンティア」 by Steed from Pothrad village. talk to Randall in Felmentia inn.)

Randall:
It looks like you've got the preparations. Then, I shall guide you.

[Randall has joined as a traveler!]

(exit Felmentia)

Randall:
First we head east from here.

(go east)

Randall:
Next we head north. It's hard to see, but there is a road that comes out of a castle ruin.

(go north 2 maps until you reach rock in front of Safeguards' Sanctuary)

Yurii:
A dead end...?

Randall:
If I remember right... like this...

Wendy:
What a neat mechanism...

Randall:
Ah, I was right.
Our destination is ahead of here.

Rukias:
What's this place?

Randall:
The village of the Dragon Orb safeguarders. I saw a battleship of 2000 years ago underground here.
However, it's quite submerged in water from a flood.
Well then, my guidance is up to here. Please ask the villagers for more.

Wendy:
Thank you very much, Randall.

Rukias:
Then let's talk to the village chief.

(go inside and talk to chief)

Chief:
Who are you people?

Wendy:
Umm, we came from Esgrentz continent.

Chief:
From an outside continent?

Wendy:
Yes, we heard there is a 2000 year old battleship here... We want to go there!

Chief:
What will you do there? I cannot allow ancient information to be abused. If that possibility exists...

Rukias:
There is no need to worry, sir. We would never do such abuse.

Chief:
What is your motive?

Rukias:
I am from the great land village. I came to return the stolen Dragon Orb.

Chief:
The great land village? Do you have proof?

Merklich:
1) We don't have proof
2) I myself am the proof (*)
3) Remain Silent

Chief:
Ohh, that is certainly the mark of the Brave Guard on your face.
I see, there is no proof more than that. Then, where is the Shrine Maiden?

Rukias:
She cannot come due to circumstances. Therefore we have to return the Dragon Orb.
And for that, we need to go to the battleship underground.
Chief sir, please let us pass.

Chief:
There is no reason for me to decline people from the great land village. I shall comply.
But, if you're going underground, then prepare yourselves.
You may use the village's facilities freely. I will open the gate to the underground.

(talk again)

Chief:
The seal covering the continent has disappeared... People from the great land village have visited...
Our purpose here will probably soon come to an end.

(go outside)

Rukias:
What? Your face looks like you want to ask something.

Wendy:
Yeah.
What is this village, and what is Rukias' relation to it...

Rukias:
You remember before at Leystan when we talked to an old survivor of the village?
The great land's Shrine Maiden must go once every 200 years to this continent to strengthen the seal on the Dragon Orb.
The people of this village are a clan that protects the Dragon Orb on this continent.

Yurii:
And so by just looking at the marks on the hero's face, they'll assent to everything.

Rukias:
Yeah, that's right. The color of the Shrine Maiden's eyes are different. And the Brave Guard has symbols on his face.
It's easy to tell from these two characteristics if nothing else.

Wendy:
But, although they're a clan that protects the Dragon Orb, they don't have it now. Why?

Rukias:
Well, it's the first time I've come here.
It's probably something to do with the Admonisher using the Dragon Orb?

Yurii:
As far as I know, there was a period several hundred years ago where the Dragon Orb changed from people's hands one after another.
Possibly in that perod the Dragon Orb was taken away, and somehow or other taken back, and was used for the Admonisher 20 years ago.
Perhaps, in the past of this village's people, the Dragon Orb was stolen and taken back repeatedly, and has a history of struggle...

Rukias:
Yeah... this village protects the Dragon Orb like we protect the Shrine Maiden.
For the sake of protecting the future of this planet, then many lives are scattered, the number is unknown...

(make preparations at inn. it also is a shop. go inside maing building and talk to man by entrance)

Man:
Will you go underground?

Merklich:
1) Yes (*)
2) No

(go through cave by taking left stairs, follow path all the way
until you see a lever. pull it, go back to entrance and go to
the righthand stairs. take other stairs and find another lever
and pull it. go back to start of cave and go through.
enter ship, and go to the water at left)


Rukias:
It's submerged from here, just like we were told.

Wendy:
It's time for that thing.

(use diving tool, 小型浸水具)

[Will you proceed ahead using the small model diving tool?]
1) Yes (*)
2) No

(defeat all monsters. make Wendy stand on a red circle)

Wendy:
Hm? It seems like something lighted moved.

(make Rukias stand on another circle, and Merklich touch the 2 remaining circles. on next screen, go through the door to the colored buttons)

Yurii:
Apparently, in fixed periods the lamps will change.
Can use use this to make them all light?

(use panel)

[There are 4 buttons lined up. Which button will you press?]
1) Yellow
2) Green
3) Red
4) Blue
5) Nothing

(touch either the buttons or the lamps themselves to make
them all light. Yellow and blue buttons do not work, and
green and red lamps do not work. manipulate them accordingly.
go through door)

Wendy:
All of the walls are closed. We can't go ahead.

Rukias:
Can you give up when we've come this far?
In any case, this battleship is no longer used. We can probably just destroy it.

(attack a wall)

[Warning
Detected abnormality inside the ship. Remove the intruders.]

Yurii:
Guardians! Please be careful!

Yurii:
We're being targeted in this status! Please have caution!

(reach the furthest wall)

Yurii:
There is a switch in the left hand side. If we use that we can probably stop the alert status.

(use the switch)

Yurii:
The warning noise has gone away. The guardians should probably stop coming.

(defeat enemies by Rukias and magic. enter next screen)

Wendy:
Is this the deepest part?
It looks like a hangar.

Yurii:
If Niara powder is here, it must be inside that room?

Rukias:
Hey, I have a bad premonition. Let's be careful.

[Warning
Defense system confirming power restoration. System will operate.]

Rukias:
Look, it's come out!

======================================
MISSION BATTLE 14 Guardian of the Ancient Ship
[[Clear Conditions
- Obtain Neara Powder and escape from this floor
- Defeat Mech Serpent

Game Over Conditions
- All party members defeated]]
--------------------------------------
Complete: Defeat all enemies
Clear: Defeat all other spheres except the top right one (purple)
Failed: Defeat only the sphere at top right (purple)
======================================

(make the serpent shoot a glowing sphere by surrounding it with characters)

Yurii:
It was able to damage the small guardian.
If we can make use of the enemy's attack well like this...

(defeat the purple sphere)

[Warning:
Support unit A is suspended. Defense support function has been released.]

Yurii:
The barrier wall disappeared! Now you can probably attack it!

(get the Niara powder from chest)

Yurii:
It's this! Even though it's from 2000 years ago, I feel a strong power...

Wendy:
Well then let's go back!

(if defeat the Serpent)

[Warning
Defense system out of function. System stopped. Defense function directly controlled by system will have lock released.]

(exit with Return spell if you have. go to Pothrad village
by using Steed from Felmentia. talk to Pothrad Patriarch)


Wendy:
Sir Patriarch, we returned with Niara powder.

Patriarch:
I see. Then as promised I will make the absorption slab.

+Gave the Niara Powder!+

Patriarch:
It will take until tomorrow to prepare it, so you can rest next door tonight.

Wendy:
Thank you very much.

(go to rest)

Yurii:
With this we shall prepare to return history.

Rukias:
I have one question. Shuweizer killed a certain man in the past to make time flow into what it is now?
Then, we'll go to that time and return history.

Yurii:
Yes, that is right.

Rukias:
Then, in that returned history the Queen Screaper multiplied, so this time we'll be present at defeating the Queen and seal it with this stone.

Yurii:
Yes, that was the plan. We'll have to think of a way to do so.

Wendy:
A way?

Yurii:
We will have to travel through time twice.
The first time we move, we have a destination. But the second, we'll have to somehow be present with Korin's hero at defeating the Queen...

Wendy:
With your power can you send us there?

Yurii:
No, it's impossible.
I do have a stronger power than other fairies when it concerns time.
But with my power I can only use time distortions to send us, using all my might.

Wendy:
Then, if we had more fairies, can it be done?

Yurii:
That may be possible, but...

Wendy:
Other than Yurii, who was the fairy that had strong power with the flow of time?

Yurii:
It is Mira in Totuwa village.

Wendy:
Then let's go ask her!

Yurii:
Umm... I wonder if she will listen?

Rukias:
If we don't try then we won't know, so all that's left is to do it, right?

Wendy:
Okay then, after tonight passes and we get the absorption slab, let's go!

Pothrad:
Good morning, humans.
The Patriarch is calling for you.

Wendy:
The absorption slab must be finished!

(talk to Patriarch)

Patriarch:
Did you sleep well?
The promised absorption slab is perfectly finished.

+Obtained Absorption Slabs!+

Patriarch:
It's simple to use.
First, using four slabs, make a magic circle.
If the Queen Screaper dies within 100 meters of the magic circle, then it will be absorbed by this slab.
Well, but the Queen Screaper is already no more...

Wendy:
Thank you very much.

(exit village and go toward the tunnel to Totuwa)

Yurii:
Do you remember where Totuwa village is? It's right after you get out of this tunnel north.

(go to Totuwa inn and talk to Mira)

Mira:
What's the matter, Yurii? The debate contest is still not open yet.

Yurii:
Umm... I came for a different matter.

Mira:
Your speech seems weak. That's not like it for the reputation of the Queen of Pixies?

Yurii:
I know...
The truth is I want to borrow your power, Mira.

Mira:
Is this about the future of this planet?

Yurii:
How did you know...?

Mira:
Since you appeared with these humans, the flow of time has become confused. I did a little foreseeing.
Every time something happens in the past, the future greatly changes, so my foreseeing was completely useless.

Yurii:
You know up to that much?

Mira:
I didn't know until now that there were humans who could change the past. I was surprised.
But, if it's related to you, then I can consent to changing the past.
So then, you want to borrow my power?

Yurii:
I can send these people to the past using a time distortion. But if there is no distortion, then I cannot.
If you have a stronger power with time than I do, then I wonder if you can send them to the past even without using a time distortion?

Mira:
That is impossible. Even with me, or combining both yours and my power, it is impossible to move to another time from nothing.

Yurii:
......

Mira:
However, if we borrow the power from other fairies, it is probably not impossible.
With Lily of Zerdok and Nora of Jaergen, who excel in reading thoughts within objects joining support, all four members are required...
...Hm, it may work with this.

Yurii:
Mira...

Mira:
I would have never thought that you would ask the help of other fairies.
But you've come here despite that. That is enough reason to help you.

Yurii:
Thank you very much, Mira...

Mira:
I will take care of the other fairies. You all fulfill what it is you need to do.

Wendy:
Thank goodness, they will help us.
So then, the next course of action...

Yurii:
First let us return history back to normal.
The person who was supposed to enter the Peace Maintenance Brigade was killed in Warslee village in the past.
We must prevent that from happening.

(go to Warslee, talk to Korin)

Korin:
Ah, Yurii! Wha, what should I do... he... he... in the past...

Yurii:
Don't make such a pitiable face. We have come to help.

Korin:
What, no way! Is such a thing possible?

Yurii:
With me, don't you think think it is?

Korin:
...Ugh...how mortifying, but now I can only depend on you...

Yurii:
...Heh. Leave it to me.

(check the time distortion in bottom right)

Yurii:
Then, we will transfer to the past. Are you ready?

1) Yes (*)
2) No

Korin:
Please, everyone, save him!

Shuweizer:
Damn, Screapers are here. More importantly, what is that Screaper with limbs?

Mutant Screaper:
...I.. can't... let you...
He is... like my... little brother...
I'll absolutely... not let you...

Yurii:
He's there! He's still alive!

Rukias:
Knight Screapers? What a difficult situation...

Wendy:
That Screaper with arms... it looks like he's protecting the collapsed person.

Yurii:
That person is Korin's hero.

Shuweizer:
Those guys!? How did they come here?

Wendy:
We can't let you kill him!

Shuweizer:
You know what I was going to do!? Then, you came from the future like me!?
And you want to fight against me!
Then I will kill you here!

======================================
MISSION BATTLE 15 Rescue Haschen
[[Clear Conditions
- All enemies defeated

Game Over Conditions
- Death of young man
- All party members defeated]]
--------------------------------------
Complete: Mutant Screaper survives, and 3 or more enemies defeated by own team
Clear: 2 enemies defeated by own team, or 3 enemies defeated but Mutant Screaper is killed
Failed: 1 or less enemies defeated by own team
======================================

(if Mutant Screaper dies. don't let that happen)

Mutant Screaper:
I can't... go any.. further... I leave... the rest... in your hands...

Yurii:
That was...? ...Could it be that it was human once?

(Shuweizer defeated)

Shuweizer
Damn, it failed! I'll have to retreat from here!

(Mutan Screaper activates ultrasonic wave barrier)

Mutant Screaper:
Around... me... if you're.... near me... the Screapers.... will weaken...

Rukias:
What? It's saying that the Screapers will weaken if we get near it?

Yurii:
What kind of power is it that can weaken Screapers?
No, now is not the time to ponder!
We cannot fight the Knight Screapers like this. Do as he says!

(pick up the thing that Shuweizer dropped)

Wendy:
Isn't this the gem that Shuweizer used to fight Screapers?

(after battle)

Wendy:
We did it! History will return, right?

Murant Screaper:
Thank...you... my regret... is that...

Wendy:
You are?

Mutant Screaper:
I don't have... long... While I still have a human mind... I'll go to the ocean... ughh...!

Wendy:
A human mind...

Yurii:
Let's return to the present time.

Wendy:
History has really been restored, right?

Yurii:
Yes. There is no mistake.

Wendy:
It's still ruins here so I can't tell.

Yurii:
Before the Queen Screaper divided, this village was restored.

Rukias:
Then, if we can seal the Queen Screaper then this village wouldn't be destroyed again?

Yurii:
Yes. If Mira and the others can send us to the past, and we use that Absorption slab...

Rukias:
But before that, I have one question. How do we go to Kaiseris Island?
Can we go like before with the ebb tide?

1) Use the same route as before
2) That route is dangerous
3) We should use a boat (*)
4) Remain silent

Wendy:
Huh? We'll have to find a boat to go?
What about going through ebb tide like before?

Yurii:
No, that won't be good.

Rukias:
Why? We went to the island that way before. Won't it work?

Yurii:
It was a major matter in history for Korin's hero and his group to go defeat the Queen.
We're not supposed to be there when we originally weren't there.
Up to now we traveled through time to return the history to what it originally was.
However, what we are about to do is change the original history. Whatever happens cannot be accurately predicted.
Therefore, in order to reduce risk we should act along with the original history as much as possible

Rukias:
But, to get to the island, we'll have to find a boat conveniently like that?

Wendy:
I wonder if there are any in this area?

(talk to PMB soldier)

PMB Soldier:
Ahh...

Wendy:
What's wrong?

PMB Soldier:
The boat that was finally repaired got buried in rubble.
Although it was finally fixed, no one rode it...

Wendy:
If we can go to the past, then the boat should be fine.

Yurii:
Then, we know where it is.

Mira:
I made you wait, Yurii.

Yurii:
Mira... everyone...

Nina:
Huh, so it was true.
I never thought that Yurii of all fairies would seek help from us.

Nora:
Nina, that's enough. Yurii wouldn't be that stubborn.

Lily:
Thanks to all of you, Master Gaerik was saved. Please let me return the favor.

Nina:
I'll also have to thank you for saving Sherris.

Yurii:
Everyone... thank you very much.
However, this is dangerous...

Mira:
We will go having full acknowledgment of the danger. There is no need to worry more.
More importantly, in order to reduce risk even in the slightest, I don't want to let loose the present still remaining in the effects of the distortion you used last time.
Are your preparations ready?

1) I still have preparations to finish
2) I am ready (*)

Mira:
Then we will start.
Lily, the traces of the past!

Lily:
Yes!
A very suitable time is... only directly after Korin's group has entered Kaiseris Island...
I cannot find a better point than that.

Yurii:
Then, to there! We will do something then!

Lily:
Understood...
......
I've grasped the time... now!

Mira:
Then we will link the time. Nora! Everyone link your minds! Nina, put up support!

Nora:
Yes!

Nina
Leave it to me!

Mira:
The past is coming into appearance. Yurii, now!

Yurii:
Yes! Everyone, let's go!

Wendy:
Oh, it's not ruins! Then it was a success?

Yurii:
Yes. Well, let's hurry to Kaiseris Island!

(talk to PMB Soldier)

PMB Soldier:
Huh, you want to use my boat?
Of course! After all, tools are to be used!
I will prepare it immediately at the beach.

PMB Soldier:
It is placed at the beach. You can use it freely.
Be careful.

Merchant:
I wonder if I can sell new goods...
Okay, I have to work hard!

(go to beach)

Rukias:
With this we'll go to the island, huh?

Yurii:
Yes, let us hurry!

(check the boat)

Yurii:
When we go to Kaiseris Island we won't have time to return. Are you prepared?

1) Yes
2) No

Wendy:
I'm not good on ships, but I'll endure, I'll endure...

Rukias:
Somehow we made it to land without being attacked by Screapers.

Wendy:
It doesn't look like we can dock anywhere other than this place. We'll have to walk from here.
More importantly, do we have enough time?

Yurii:
......
There are still traces of the Queen alive. But it would be better to hurry!

(go to cave entrance)

Yurii:
We can't take too much time but we can rest at the boat so that we can proceed in perfect condition.

Wendy:
It looks kind of man-made.

Rukias:
According to legend from the great land village, it seems they made large-scale preparations in order to seal the Queen.
They probably made this at that time.

Wendy:
If so then it's not mistaken from the point of where we landed.

(reach top floor)

Rukias:
Is this the deepest area?

Yurii:
Ah, this is...

Rukias:
What's the matter?

Yurii:
This is unmistakeably the place.
This must be where they used the absorption slabs 2000 years ago.

Rukias:
Can you see the past?

Yurii:
Yes, many humans' hearts with the volition to defeat the Queen... are transmitted.
There should be pedestals to place the stone slabs. First we put those...

Rukias:
Hey, wasn't that from above?

Wendy:
It looks like it has begun.

Yurii:
All right, please prepare the slabs.

(check a pedestal)

[There is a pedestal with an incantation carved in the surface. It seems like something may be placed on it.]

(select 吸引の石版. repeat for the other stands)

Wendy:
It looks like we made it in time.
Now we just wait for the Queen Screaper to be defeated.

Female android:
......

Wendy:
Wh-what?

Female android:
Protect... Queen...
Remove... intruders...

Rukias:
It seems that the situation is not so good.

Yurii:
If the slabs are destroyed, then all our hard work will be a failure! Please be careful.

======================================
MISSION BATTLE 16 Seal the Queen Screaper
[[Clear Conditions
- Prevent the Slabs from being destroyed until it's time to seal the Queen
- Defeat all enemies

Game Over Conditions
- Any slab destroyed
- All party members defeated]]
--------------------------------------
Complete: Defeated Neilis before Queen is sealed
Clear: Didn't defeat Neilis before Queen is sealed, defeated 5 or more guardians
Failed: Didn't defeat Neilis before Queen is sealed, defeated 4 or less guardians
======================================

(when get near the android)

Yurii:
Just what is this enemy...? A certain type of guardian?

(if Rukias attacks or gets attacked by android)

Rukias:
Ugh! What is this thing? A battle puppet!?

(if defeat android)

Female Android:
Damage value... increased... Strategy continuation... unable...
...Withdraw from battlefront...

(after time runs out)

Yurii:
The... the Queen is defeated!?

(if android is still alive)

Female Android:
Strategy failed... Move quickly to... next stage...

(after battle)

Yurii:
We did it! Now the flow of history has surely changed!

Rukias:
But we don't know where the Dragon Orb is again.

Yurii:
No, I have an idea where it is.
The Dragon Orb should still be inside the crashed Admonisher.

Wendy:
I hope it's not crushed.

Rukias:
The Dragon Orb is the incarnation of the planet. You would need power enough to break the planet to break the Dragon Orb.

Wendy:
All right, let's hurry so that it doesn't get taken by someone else!

(exit and return to boat to Warslee)

Yurii:
You worked hard and did well. Let's return to the present.

Wendy:
We made it back in good order. The plan was a great success!
Yurii, it was an amazing achievement!

Yurii:
No, it was Mira's work more than mine.
The fairies gave all their might to send us to the past.

Wendy:
What, really!? We ended up doing something bad...
If we have free time, we have to meet them!

Rukias:
That is so, but we still have something to do. We need to hurry and find the Dragon Orb.

Yurii:
The Dragon Orb is inside the Admonisher, but it was seriously damaged before the fight against the Queen.

Wendy:
Then would it be better to ask for information from the Peace Maintenance Brigade?

(approach dungeon girls in Warslee)

Dungeon Girl:
(... According to the members on the results of this discussion, this test is a failure.)
That is the message from the elder, sister...

Dungeon Girl:
Agh! Sister!

Dungeon Lady:
...A... failure...
How could it...
Even though the exterior was not compromised...

Dungeon Girl:
That's right! There is no other well that has such a splendid roof!

Dungeon Lady:
......
...When I think about it, I didn't make it, that roof was already there...

Dungeon Girl:
But, but, look! It's abundant in many variations!

Dungeon Lady:
...The fairy said it was dull...

Dungeon Girl:
But, but! It has mastery priviledges...

Dungeon Lady:
......
That is the only objective to entering a dungeon...
Ah... the more I think about it, the flaws show...

Dungeon Girl:
...Ah.. uhh... umm... umm...

Dungeon Lady:
That's it... that's it...! Eleven levels are incomplete, and there is no boss!

Dungeon Girl:
Oh, sister...! Get a hold of yourself...
......
This time is not the final test! Can't we challenge again?

Dungeon Lady:
...Heh, heh heh heh.

Dungeon Girl:
Sister!?

Dungeon Lady:
That's it.. that's it... This time is a trial to attain the main test's qualifications! If we don't fail the final examination it's fine!
Yes, because it's not the final examination, then it was a mistake when I was holding back!
Even for a lion to catch a rabbit, it will fall in a thousand valleys!

Dungeon Girl:
Um, sister, that's not...

Dungeon Lady:
Next time I'll go with full force from the beginning!

Dungeon Girl:
Sister, calm down!

Dungeon Lady:
First, I'll go to the new continent and collect information about dungeons!

Dungeon Girl:
Ah, sister!

(exit village. go west and north. if you check the Naton tree...)

[The Naton fruit has begun to change color. It will be ripe in a little more time.]

Yurii:
This is a Naton fruit.

Wendy:
What! This is the fabled Naton fruit?

Yurii:
Fabled is a bit exaggerated. Sure it is rare, but...

Wendy:
Of course it is! This is extinct in Esgrentz continent!

Yurii:
Oh, is that so...

Wendy:
That unique texture, that flavor that makes the mouth water...

Yurii:
...At any rate, it's still not ready for picking.

(go north to PMB. talk to soldier with chat bubble)

PMB Soldier:
Once, we had a weapon called Admonisher.
Although it's called a weapon, we don't fight with it.  Rather, it was a power to stop war.

Merklich:
1) Ask for details (*)
2) Stay silent

PMB Soldier:
However we lost the Admonisher to defeat the Queen Screaper.
Cyriltia and Grangale also cooperated to defeat the Queen, and showed understanding.
However after the foreign enemy was gone, then the countries cross swords eventually again.

Now that we do not have the Admonisher, we have to brace up and devote ourselves for the sake of world peace.
...Hm, I know... Why don't we jointly give each other information?

(go to headquarters gate and find Haschen)

Korin
Ah, Yurii!

Haschen:
It's been a while, Yurii.

Yurii:
It is great to see that Korin's hero is well.

Haschen:
And yourself? Did you also find a hero?

Yurii:
Yes.

Haschen:
I am Haschen of the Peace Maintenance Brigade's operations division. Nice to meet you.

1) Name yourself (*)
2) Don't name yourself

Wendy:
I am Wendy. And this is Rukias.

Korin:
I'm Korin. Nice to meet you!

Yurii:
At any rate, Korin's hero, today we came to earnestly speak with you.
It's actually about the Dragon Orb...

Haschen:
It's a story hard to believe...

Korin:
But...

Haschen:
I know, Korin. Fairies do not lie. What they say must be the truth.
Krious is in the headquarters. Come with me.
Inside here.

Korin:
Thank you, everyone. You saved him.
You all saved him probably just to correct history, but...
...But, even so I'm really glad! I knew that a world without him would be awful!
So, thank you so very much!
Well then, he will take you to Krious so continue to follow him!

Haschen:
It's the second floor inside that building on the high ground. Follow me.

(talk to Haschen)

Haschen:
Inside here.

(go to 2nd floor and Haschen will knock on Krious' door)

Haschen:
Krious, it's me.

Krious:
You can enter.

Haschen:
Well, let's go in.

Krious
What's the matter, in such a big group?

Haschen:
First, won't you listen to their story?

Yurii:
Pleasure to meet you, Sir Krious. I am Yurii.
These people came from an outside continent...

Krious:
Sealed in the Dragon Orb...

Rukias:
Yeah. My clan has lived that way for 2000 years.

Krious:
...I see.
I will cooperate if you abolutely do not abuse the Dragon Orb.
However you can't recover it now. I will put out communications so that you can enter the recovery scene.

Haschen:
I will go and give word.

Krious:
All right.

Although the seal has just recently lifted, there are already people after the Dragon Orb from other continents?
The Dragon Orb safeguarders must be uneasy.
At any rate, we now have no need for the Admonisher or the Dragon Orb.
More importantly we must not let it be abused. I will leave it to you.

Yurii:
Thank you very much, Sir Krious.

Wendy:
So then, where should we go...

Krious:
When you exit out of here and follow the road east, there is a rope ladder going down the cliff.

Wendy:
Thank you very much.

(go to PMB exit)

Haschen:
Everything's good. I've given instructions to the soldiers. When you step outside, head east for a bit.
There is a rope ladder to go down the surface of the cliff south.
From there you should be able to go to the crash site.

Yurii:
Thank you very much.

Fanille:
Ah, Haschen? Who are they?

Haschen:
Fanille, they are ones who saved my life.

Fanille:
What! Did something dangerous happen again?!

Korin:
Actually...

Fanille:
Such an incident...
Everyone, thank you very much!

It must have been awful to Korin.

Korin:
Truly! In the time he wasn't here, I wondered what in the world I would do.

Fanille:
...An outside continent?

Korin:
What is it, Fanille?

Fanille:
No, it's nothing. Please keep working hard, everyone.

Korin:
All right, do your best!

(go to Fanille's lab and talk to her)

Fanille:
Ah, thanks for what you did earlier.
Speaking of which, you came from an outside continent?
Is it all right if you let me hear about the outside continent?

Yurii:
Ah, yes. The outside continent...

Fanille:
So your technology is much more advanced than that of this continent.
Uh, umm...! It's rude of me to ask such a thing, but could you give me something from that continent?
I have a research that I absolutely must complete, and I've been searching for something that will be a clue...
I am sorry for the poor manners, but please!

(show her Pollumine seed, ポリュミネの種)

+Gave the Pollumine Seed!+

Fanille:
Oh, thank you very much!
If this can be a lead to curing Haschen's body...

Yurii:
What's wrong with Korin's hero?

Fanille:
Eek! Did--I-- did I say something!?
It's--it's nothing!
Everyone, thank you very much!

(go outside, east 2 maps, to the rope ladder)

Wendy:
Are you all right?

PMB Soldier:
Strange men appeared... The Dragon Orb is in danger... I am all right... hurry and get the Dragon Orb...

(use the ladder)

Monopolis Captain:
Hmph, it's you!

Rukias:
I knew it was Monopolis...

Wendy:
In this condition it looks like we still can't obtain the Dragon Orb.

Monopolis Captain:
We cannot let you go to where Shuweizer is!
We will defend here to the last!

Monopolis Soldier:

Grr, those guys!

Monopolis Captain:
You're late! Help repel these guys! (Shuweizer appears)

Shuweizer:
I thought it was noisy outside. It's the traitors...

Monopolis Soldier:
Sir Shuweizer! Did you find the Dragon Orb?

Shuweizer:
Yes, I found it.
I will head to the boat. You guys stop them here!

Monopolis Soldier:
Yes sir!

Yurii:
Ah, he got away! Everyone, please hurry!

Yurii:
We'll pursue him quickly.

Wendy:
But where did he go?

Rukias:
He said it before to a staff member, didn't he?

Wendy:
I see...That's the only trail.
Do you know where it is?

1) Yes: (*)
2) No

Yurii:
Nu Nahn.

Wendy:
Then let's hurry! We don't have time to waste!

Yurii:
As I thought he fled east. Let's go after him!

(go east to bridge to Grangale)

Wendy:
Uhh, the lake seems strange somehow.

Yurii:
This is where twenty years ago the Admonisher fired its first shot.
It scarred the ground so deeply that the underground waters sprung and became a lake like this.

Wendy:
The scar of the cannon... it must have had a lot of victims.

Yurii:
...Yes... Thanks to that twenty years ago, war was prevented...

Rukias:
The price to pay for peace is high...
It would have just been good if there was no conflict from the beginning...

(go near Zerdok and to the Monopolis people north)

Monopolis Captain:
We won't let you stop Shuweizer! You will die here!

You did well. Are you all right, everyone?
Zerdok city is right nearby. We must hurry but we can make preparations there and go after him.

(go north, east, north, and west)

Shuweizer:
They are stubborn!

Woman:
Hand over the Dragon Orb. That thing is not to be handled so easily.

Resistance Member:
Lady Iristelessa, please leave this to us!
Wha, what is that!?
Ugghhh!

Android:
...Take the great land's... Shrine Maiden... with you...

Iristelessa:
Huh?

Shuweizer:
This woman is the great land's Shrine Maiden? I thought it was just the Resistance but to meet the Shrine Maiden in such a place...

Android:
...Take the great land's... Shrine Maiden... with you...

Rukias:
The Shrine Maiden!?

Wendy:
That woman is in danger!

Rukias:
Please, don't let her get taken away by them!
If she's taken away, it's the world's end!

Wendy:
End of the world!?

Rukias:
If the Dragon Orb and the Shrine Maiden fall into enemy's hands, it's the same as taking away all of the planet!

Shuweizer:
Hey, you over there! Are you my ally?

Neilis:
My name is Neilis... To take the great land's Shrine Maiden, I was ordered to support Shuweizer.
I will obliterate those people who fight against Monopolis...

(Resistance member defeated)

Resistant Member:
Lady Iristelessa...!

(Resistance member defeated)

Resistant Member:
Iristelessa... please run...

Neilis:
Guards are removed. After the Shrine Maiden's resistance is prevented, restrain her.

Iristelessa:
Ugh... to be captured now...

Rukias:
Shrine Maiden! We will defend you, so please follow our instructions!

Iristelessa:
It doesn't look like I have much choice... Understood. What should I do?

Merklich:
1) Make her specialize in magic
2) Instruct her to run east (*)
3) Instruct her to run south
4) Let her act freely

Iristelessa:
Understood.

(get near Neilis)

Neilis:
It's you again...
How many times will you appear before me until you are satisfied? How many times will you be killed until you are satisfied?

1) I will not be killed by you (*)
2) What are you talking about?
3) Say nothing and focus on battle

Neilis:
You still have confidence, but I will kill you however many times it takes.
Previously it was 3 years ago. Before that was 201 years ago. Furthermore before that was 398 years ago.
Do you understand? I will not lose to mass reproductions like you. As always, you can die!

(defeat Neilis)

+Obtained Barrier Breaker Ring!+

Neilis:
...Ugh.... this pain in my head... what is it...!

(defeat Shuweizer)

Shuweizer:
Ughh!

+Obtained Dragon Orb!+

Shuweizer:
Damn it! All that I've worked for up to now...

(after battle)

Iristelessa.
Let me thank you.

Rukias:
I want to confirm one thing, but are you the great land's Shrine Maiden?

Iristelessa:
There is no use hiding it at this point.
I am Iristelessa. The great land's Shrine Maiden.
And you?

Rukias:
I'm a survivor of the great land's village. My name's Rukias.

Iristelessa:
The village? Is that so...

Rukias:
I have something I want to ask. Why did you disappear from the village?

Iristelessa:
It was not my will. I was taken with someone.

Rukias:
Someone?

Iristelessa:
The leader of the Resistance organization, Land's Prayer, Maxwell.

Wendy:
...Maxwell...? The leader of the Resistance is Maxwell?
Is that true, lady Shrine Maiden?

Irisitelessa:
Please call me Iris. It is better not to let my position be known.

Wendy:
Then, Miss Iris, is it true that the Resistance leader is Maxwell?

Iristelessa:
It is true.
The Land's Prayer leader, Maxwell, took me from the village.

Rukias:
And then you came to be a subordinate of the Resistance?

Iristelessa:
That is not so. I am only borrowing their strength.
I am doing so now to also fulfill the mission as the great land's Shrine Maiden.

Rukias:
If that's so, then why didn't you return to the village?

Iristelessa:
I went there several times. But, the village was already destroyed...
To escape from the search by the large corporation, I couldn't go on search openly.
More importantly, now there is a greater matter.
The Brave Guard there. Show the Dragon Orb to me.

(show 龍玉 to Iristelessa)

Iristelessa:
...I knew it. It's no longer inside it.

Rukias:
It can't be, the seal is?

Iristelessa:
Yes. 2000 years ago an invader from another world appeared in this world.
It's soul was sealed inside the Dragon Orb, but looks already gone.

Rukias:
Hey, how can you be so calm when the seal has broken?
Isn't this a grave matter?!

Iristelessa:
I was able to predict that the seal has already broken.
After I came to this continent, I followed the steps of the previous seal's Shrine Maiden.
However there was no record of the previous age's seal strengthening 200 years ago.

Rukias:
Certainly every 200 years the Shrine Maiden goes to strengthen the seal.

Iristelessa:
But this time there was no record of the seal being strengthened.

Yurii:
There was a time when the Dragon Orb passed from people's hands to another, so maybe the Shrine Maiden couldn't get close to it.

Iristelessa:
That is possibly so.
From the condition of the Dragon Orb, the Shrine Maiden has not fulfilled the mission for 400 years.

Wendy:
No way! Then the invader that was sealed in there is now revived?

Iristelessa:
Yes. The invader with a spirit form, Infinitor, will transfer to and possess humans.

Wendy:
Then that means, it's already inside someone...
What do we do? Can we find and defeat that person?

Iristelessa:
The spirit form Infinitor cannot be killed. It will only flee into yet another body.
Therefore, there is no other way except to seal it in the Dragon Orb.
...Brave Guard. I do not know the whole story of when you awoke, but abide by that mission and defend me.
I will request help from you too. In order to seal the invader again, please come with me and the Dragon Orb.

Rukias:
Do you know where the invader is? Where is it?

Iristelessa:
Monopolis headquarters highest floor.

Wendy:
Then, the commander?

Iristelessa:
Monopolis corporation commander Brandole.
The invader's soul of 2000 years ago is lodged in him.

1) Unbelievable
2) I believe it (*)
3) Remain silent

Wendy:
Now that you say that, the one who had us search for the Dragon Orb was the commander.
He's probably concerned about being sealed again.

Iristelessa:
Perhaps that is so. I also worried about that when I was captured.

Rukias:
You were captured? And you were able to escape?

Iristelessa:
There was a great price to pay for that. The brave guard who was protecting me and allowing us to escape gave his life...

Wendy:
Oh my...

Iristelessa:
It is possible to think that the Infinitor has completely transferred to the Monopolis commander.
Perhaps it is the Commander's family lineage having the most authority, finding it an compatible body.

Rukias:
So then, we have to go to Monopolis.

[Iristelessa has joined your party!]

Yurii:
That reminds me, Sir Hero. The enemy dropped something a while ago?

(select 結界破りの指輪)

Iristelessa:
That is a Barrier Breaking Ring. It was to break through the barrier surrounding this continent.
Originally only people from the great land village should have one.

Yurii:
That enemy called Neilis was holding it, which means that...

1) It was stolen 400 years ago (*)
2) Neilis is related to the great land village
3) I don't have any guesses

Iristelessa:
Yes, I think so too.
This is my guess, but in the previous generations the Shrine Maiden probably failed at strengthening the seal because that ring was stolen by Neilis.
By using the stolen Barrier Breaking Ring it became possible to freely come and go onto this continent.

Yurii:
By the actions of that enemy and considering the seal, it becomes a consistency.

Iristelessa:
But knowing that it doesn't change the fact that the seal has broken.
More importantly, let us head quickly to Monopolis.
If the Infinitor finds a suitable body outside of the Monopolis Commander's family lineage, then pursuing it will become difficult.

Yurii:
However isn't it also necessary to obtain correct information?
That reminds me, there is a fairy named Nora at the inn of Jaergen.
She excels at reading the memories within things.
How about we have her look at the ring?

(go to Jaergen and talk to Nora in the inn)

Nora:
Oh, what's the matter, Yurii? You have business with me?

Yurii:
Thank you for earlier. Thanks to that we were able to change history.

Nora:
Yes, I'm glad it was a success.

Yurii:
Is your body all right?

Nora:
I'm not that bad because I supported, but Lily who directly grasped the past, and most of all Mira who sent you to the past, are quite exhausted.

Yurii:
I see... I truly can't say enough to you all...

Nora:
We fought for the sake of you saving this planet, so do not let it worry you.
More importantly, you have business with me?

Yurii:
Actually we'd like you to read the memories in an object...

Nora:
That will be quite a simple request.
What item is it?

(select 結界破りの指輪)

[Memory 1
...This is a ring to pass through the barrier. I finally killed that hated great land Shrine Maiden. Then I obtained this ring.
After that event, from the record of the ship, I knew Infinitor was sealed in the Dragon Orb, and I looked for a means to enter the sealed continent.
With this I penetrated the barrier surrounding the continent, and I was able to enter.

Memory 2
I found out that the effective range of this ring was very narrow. I finally let 2-3 people pass, and couldn't send in Screapers, but at any rate I was successful in going through the barrier.
Confirming the things that must be done. 1) Find the Dragon Orb and make the Infinitor revive. 2) Revive the sealed Queen Screaper. If these two are accomplished then I will be praised by Infinitor.

Memory 3
The Dragon Orb seems to be extremely well hidden, I still do not know its whereabouts. It is impossible to investigate the whole continent through by myself. Then, I decided to revive the sealed Queen Screaper first. Originally I was supposed to come to this place after the Dragon Orb.
Screapers have a special characteristic of acting on Infinitor's thoughts. If I use that it may be a clue to finding the Dragon Orb. I must find Infinitor quickly.

Memory 4
The barrier binding the Queen is strong. Therefore even if I can go into Kaiseris Island, it is not possible to restore the Queen itself.

Memory 5
The great land Shrine Maiden has appeared. Going after her I will find the whereabouts of the Dragon Orb. Thereupon, I discover Infinitor has already been released from the Dragon Orb. It is probably due to the Shrine Maiden being killed 200 years ago. I will kill the Shrine Maidens. After, I will look for Infinitor.

Memory 6
I discovered Infinitor on the Esgrentz continent in Jewarl country. The great Infinitor uses human bodies and applies his excelling knowledge and built the enterprise Monopolis. I directly met Infinitor.
But, you are too late! I received a harsh reprimand. Certainly since then over 1800 years have passed. So as the next mission, I am to return to the sealed land and protect the Queen until I am called. Those were thankful words.]

Nora:
A special soul form existence? I can only find out this much. I'm sorry.

Yurii:
No, thank you very much, Nora.
Sir Hero, what do you think about these memories?

1) An extremely strong hatred towards the great land maiden
2) I feel sad for her (*)
3) I don't feel anything

Nora:
She was used as a tool by Infinitor. And she doesn't even feel that herself.

(use Steed Express to go to Felmentia 「フェルメンティア前」 and walk to Pothrad village)

Neilis:
...Imaging system abnormal... Cease movements until recovery...

(approach Neilis)

Neilis:
...Life response detected in area... Imaging system... function out of order...
Switch to battle conditions... impossible... Danger... Danger...
...Who are you...?

1) Just a common traveler
2) Be concerned about her more than self (*)
3) Say nothing

Neilis:
...Hostility response is none. ...Danger level... set low.
As long as the other side has no hostility, this side will also have no intention to fight.
It is bad, but currently my eyes cannot see. I may reflect rudeness to the other side but I request acknowledgment...
Thereupon, what is your business?

Merklich:
1) What are you doing here?
2) Who are you?
3) Your comrades are not here?
4) Nothing in particular

(you may ask all)

1)
Neilis:
Imaging system... in other words my eyes have an abnormality and I cannot see anything currently.
This body must be old, recently this has been occuring frequently.
It is tentative self repairable level, but if originally, normal maintenance is... No, that is impossible, therefore I am this way.

2)
My name is Neilis. I am a loyal servant of Infinitor the absolute master.
However you probably won't understand what that is.
To fulfill that master's request, I must still work. A little more... a little more...

3)
Neilis:
Comrades...?
A long time ago there were many. However they were subordinates. But here for several hundred years there is only me.
I am the final one so I must do it... No matter what, that traitor...
...Sorry. I am not to say it before an unrelated person.

4)
Neilis:
...I see... then leave me be.
If I finish self-repairs I will be able to see you.
Doing so, I can still function... To fight for Infinitor.

Nevertheless, you are a mysterious one.
Not only do you initiate conversation with me in this state, you make me be so talkative...
Thank you, for accompanying me in idle talk. I cannot see your form, but I'll thank you.

..Hm? ...Are you leaving?
I will complete self-repairs shortly.
Although I am in such a form, if we meet again somewhere, do talk to me freely.

(go to Pothrad village and talk to patriarch)

Patriarch:
Oh, it has been a while, humans. You were able to do something daring.

Wendy:
Do you remember us...?

Patriarch:
That is obvious, isn't it? We Pothrads never forget a debt of gratitude.
You not only saved this village from that villain, you are really the ones who defeated the Queen Screaper.

Wendy:
...The real ones?

Patriarch:
Yes.
You made your clever tact effective and used the sealing slabs, didn't you?
The ones from the Peace Maintenance Brigade which do not know that existence cannot defeat the Queen with the correct procedure.
Certainly about now, the Queen multiplying would have become a serious matter.

Wendy:
Ahaha, that is certainly right!

Patriarch:
If anything happens from now I shall help you.

Wendy:
(...Looks like the best reality was corrected...!)

(use Transgate to Esgrentz, and walk east from the Transgate center
a few screens)

Rukias:
Hey, can I have a moment?

Iristelessa:
What is it?

Rukias:
A survivor of the village is here. Will you meet him for a bit?

Iristelessa:
......

1) Recommend her to meet him (*)
2) It's not particularly necessary to meet him
3) Remain silent

Iristelessa:
I see. This is probably the last chance.

Wendy:
Then, to Leystan.

(enter Leystan and rest at inn)

Rukias:
Then, I will call him. Please wait in the room.

Wendy:
Shall I go with you?

Rukias:
It's not anything special.

Wendy:
It's fine, it's fine.

Yurii:
Lady Iris. Earlier you said 'last chance', but what is that...

Iristelessa:
It's just as the words say. I am the great land's Shrine Maiden. My task is to seal the invader Infinitor... When that is accomplished, my mission is settled.

Yurii:
Settled...Are you saying you will throw your life?

Iristelessa:
It is probably fine to talk with you. However, please absolutely say no word of what I'm going to say from now.

Yurii:
Yes.

Iristelessa:
The Infinitor is to be sealed in the Dragon Orb. It is the only cage that is strong enough.
To seal the Infinitor I will perform a technique that will use my life.

Yurii:
What!?

Iristelessa:
For generations the seal Shrine Maidens use their own life to seal the Dragon Orb. However, that seal is already broken.
I will do as the first generation Shrine Maiden and extract the soul from the body, and perform the technique to enclose it inside the Dragon Orb.

Yurii:
The first generation Shrine Maiden definitely...

Iristelessa:
According to legend, it is said she stopped breathing after completing the technique.
My life will probably be consumed in the fight ahead.
The Brave Guard's mission is to protect the Shrine Maiden's life until she performs the sealing. When that time comes, your mission will also end.
Therefore, protect me until then. It is not only for me, or for you, but for all of the people living in this world.

Rukias:
I made you wait.

Old man:
Ohh! Lady Iristelessa... I am truly glad to be able to meet you...

Iristelessa:
I have made you worry until now.

Old man:
From here I heard you are headed to the seal.

Iristelessa:
Yes. I will fulfill my mission in accordance to the teaching of the village. Therefore, I will count on you after that.

Old man:
Yes, Lady Iristelessa. Please, have peace of mind.

Yurii:
Good morning, Sir Hero.
...Umm... about last night, about Miss Iris...
Is it still all right to go seal the Infinitor?
Iris's time remaining now is little...
Isn't there anything we can do for her in the last?

1) Give a present (*)
2) Leave behind a portrait of her
3) Have fun together
4) There is no need

Yurii:
A present?

(exit room)

Yurii:
Good morning, everyone.

Rukias:
Well then, let's depart.

(use Transgate outside Leystan to go to Makinus, go to Monopolis building)

Rukias:
We are to defeat the commander in the highest floor of this building?

Iristelessa:
No, not defeat, but seal the soul in the Dragon Orb.

Wendy:
We have to seal it?

Iristelessa:
I inherit the knowledge of generations of Shrine Maidens. According to it, there is no way to defeat the invader. Therefore we continue to seal it inside the Dragon Orb.

Wendy:
I see...
But after you seal the invader's soul, will the commander return to a normal human?

Iristelessa:
There is dim hope of that. When the invader possesses a body, the original body's soul is terminated.
Therefore, when the invader's soul is sealed, the body loses soul...

Rukias:
To defeat it or to seal it, either way there will be a dead body.

Iristelessa:
No, two bodies.

Wendy:
Huh, there are two commanders?

Iristelessa:
No, that's not so.
One will be the commander. The other will be myself.

Wendy:
What!?

Iristelessa:
It requires my life to seal the invader's soul.

Wendy:
No...!

Iristelessa:
That is the mission I was born for as a great land Shrine Maiden.  It is a mission to save the world.
And until the Shrine Maiden fulfills the mission, it is the duty of the villagers and the Brave Guard to support her.
Please, I request of you until the end.

Wendy:
......

Iristelessa:
Do you have any questions?

1) What is the real form of the invader?
2) What is the invader's objective?
3) What will happen if we leave it as is?
4) I have no questions

1)
Iristelessa:
2000 years ago it came to this planet in a celestial ship. It is said to be the life of another planet.
Iristelessa:
Anything else?

2)
Iristelessa:
His objective is to steal the power, the energy of this planet...
And then he would take it away. Therefore, we absolutely have to prevent that...
Anything else?

3)
Iristelessa:
He will soon take away this planet. When the celestial ship flies off he will pass to other planets and this planet will be swallowed up and extinguished.
My ancestors fought with their lives knowing this, and paid lives to seal the Infinitor until a barrier covered the whole continent.
Anything else?

4)
Iristelessa:
Then, let us go!

Wendy:
That reminds me, our employee ID's don't let us go to the Commander's floor, do they?

Iristelessa:
What do you mean?

Wendy:
To use the elevator we have to pass our ID in the machine, but to go to the highest floor where the commander is, we need a card key.

Iristelessa:
No... We came up to here...
Is there any way somehow?

1) Climb the outside wall
2) Get the card key (*)
3) Give up

Wendy:
The highest rank staff members should have a card key.
Other than that, the Commander's directly controlled guard troops.

Rukias:
The guard troops directly controlled by the commander? Where are they?

Wendy:
Of course they're inside the headquarters.

(enter headquarters building)

Wendy:
If we talk carelessly and be found out then it will be the end at once. Let's act with caution.

(try to go to top floor in elevator)

[Alert
A card key is required to access this floor. Please pass card key into scanner.]

Wendy:
Just as we thought, we need a card key to go to the Commander's floor.
...Ah, that uniform...

Yurii:
What's the matter?

Wendy:
He's from the Commander's direct troop... He should have a card key.

(exit building)

Yurii:
Where could he be going?

Wendy:
I don't know, but let's not lose sight of him!

(exit city)

Monopolis Soldier:
Officer, we came to meet you!

Monopolis Guard Captain
Yes, appreciated.

Rukias:
There's only them. Now is the best time if we're going after him, right?

Monopolis Guard Captain:
Ugh... Just who are you people...

Yurii:
We are sorry. Please be resting for a while.

[The fainted soldiers were bound and taken to an inconspicuous place.]

Rukias:
We got the thing we were aiming for. Let's go to the Commander's place before these guys wake up.

(go to Makinus and enter headquarters building)

Wendy:
If we talk carelessly and be found out then it will be the end at once. Let's act with caution.

(use elevator and use Monopolis ID and Card Key, カードキー)

Wendy:
All right!

Brandole:
Who are you people? There weren't supposed to be visitors on today's schedule?

Iristelessa:
I have come to seal you.

Brandole:
The great land's Shrine Maiden...
You've escaped once, but now you appear here again?
For you to appear in this state, you are just insects flying into a fire.

Iristelessa:
No, that's not so. I will seal you!
Prepare yourself, Infinitor!

Brandole:
You'll be captured before that!

Rukias:
We're not letting you!

Iristelessa:
Please cover me so that I can come close to the commander!

(move Iristelessa to Brandole)

Iristelessa:
This is the end!

Motherly planet, give me your strength!

Brandole:
Hahaha, what's wrong? You didn't seal me?

Iristelessa:
No, no...

Brandole:
I've been able to come up with a way to defeat that sealing means in 1500 years!

Rukias:
It's a failure! We need to bring the Shrine Maiden and escape!

[Iristelessa has left the party!]

[[Clear Conditions
- All members enter elevator

Game Over Conditions

Yurii:
Lady Shrine Maiden, stay controlled! We need to flee before the exit is blocked!

Iristelessa:
No... What should I do...

Yurii:
Keep your composure! Sir Hero, tell her!

(talk to Iristelessa)

Iristelessa:
I'm.. I'm all right... Y-yes... tell me what I should do...

1) Encourage to stay controlled (*)
2) Scold her "Do you want to get caught here?"
3) Follow Rukias
4) Follow Wendy

(Neilis enters)

Neilis:
...Capture... the great land Shrine Maiden...

Yurii:
That's...!

Brandole:
Don't think you can escape.
Go, Neilis!

Neilis:
......!
When I see your face, my head hurts...
To erase that pain... I will kill you!

(Merklich approach Neilis)

Neilis:
When Lord Infinitor's plan is complete, you will not appear again...
In other words, if you just die, then nothing will torment me any more!

Merklich:
1) You are the one who is going to die
2) I do not intend to die (*)
3) I challenge you to try it
4) How annoying...

(defeat Neilis)

Neilis:
...Damage level... exceeding... Battle continuation... impossible...
...Withdraw from battle line...

Brandole:
...Hmph, useless thing.

(Iristelessa near elevator)

Yurii:
Lady Shrine Maiden, to the elevator!

Iristelessa:
...Elevator... Yes... to go outside...

(everyone at elevator)

Yurii:
Hurry, to go down!

(after battle)

Brandole:
Don't let them escape!

Monopolis Guard Captain:
They're here! Get them!

Yurii:
They've been waiting here!

Wendy:
We cannot be captured! Let's push through them!

Rukias:
It would be terrible if the Shrine Maiden is captured. Run ahead of us!

(3 members go to exit)

Yurii:
All right, we will escape too!

Wendy:
With this commotion the front gate will be locked! We can't use the Transgate!

Rukias:
What will we do then?

Wendy:
We'll steal the speed boat!

(go to the speed boat and use)

Wendy:
Let's depart!

Iristelessa:
To Jiant Mountain... Please head to Jiant Mountain...

Wendy:
Then we'll first go to Schizarz village.

(arrive in Schizarz)

Wendy:
For the time being we were able to escape to here safely. Then, from here we'll go to Jiant Mountain?

Iristelessa:
Yes. Before the mountain this is a Resistance hideout. You all please go there.

Wendy:
You say please go there, then what do you intend to do?

Iristelessa:
My seal wasn't done, so my business still exists.
Far from that, the Infinitor intends to abuse my power.
If he does that, I'd rather...

Wendy:
W-wait, Iris!

Iristelessa:
Wendy, thank you for your help up until now.
...Brave Guard, your task has ended.
You don't need to protect me any more.

1) My mission is not over
2) This time you should help us (*)
3) Remain silent

Iristelessa:
I... help you...?

Wendy:
That's right! If we ignore the Infinitor then the world will be in danger, right?
Therefore, let's fight together!

Iristelessa:
......
...Yes.

Rukias:
All right, now that that's settled, what do we do from here...
After we get to the Resistance hideout, what will we do?
What should we do about the Infintor's soul inside the commander?

1) Look for another way to seal it
2) Defeat it instead of sealing (*)
3) Can't do anything

1) Defeat the president
2) Destroy the spirit being (*)

Rukias:
In the first place, what is a spirit form?

Iristelessa:
An existence without a physical body, that is called a spirit form.

Rukias:
So, the invader is only in spirit form?

1) It's impossible for it to have only a spirit form (*)
2) That may be so
3) Don't know

Wendy:
That's gotta be it!
The invader appeared in a ship in the sky, right?

Rukias:
Then, what is it?

Yurii:
If it's really spirit form, then it would be strange for it to have a thing like a ship.

Iristelessa:
Speaking of which the invader Infinitor's objective is to steal this planet's energy and take it back to its own planet...
Certainly if it only existed in spirit, then it wouldn't need to use a ship to look for energy.

Yurii:
In other words, even if it can move and act as a spirit form, there must be a true physical body somewhere?

Rukias:
Then that makes it easier. We'll find the true body and destroy it.

Iristelessa:
...Then our next actions are decided. First go to the Resistance, Land's Prayer's, hideout... tell them about our story now, and ask cooperation... ugh....

Wendy:
Are you all right!?

Rukias:
The means to seal the soul exchanges her life... Although it was a failure, her life energy must be very exhausted.

Iristelessa:
...I am still all right...
More importantly, it's dangerous to stay here. Let's go immediately.

(exit village, go west to the crossroad)

Iristelessa:
Land's Prayer's hideout is west. Let us hurry.

(go west and north)

Iristelessa:
The rock on the north side is a hidden door. This way.

(follow her)

Yurii:
In such a place...

Iristelessa:
The hideout is inside. Let's go in before someone sees us.

(enter cave)

Iristelessa:
The hideout is underground.

(go down ladder, and down any ladder in next screen)

Wendy:
The hideout is here...

Yurii:
It's amazing to build something like this underground...

(walk in)

Iristelessa:
...Ugh...

Resistance Member:
Lady Shrine Maiden! What is the matter? And who are they?

Iristelessa:
...I am all right... They are not suspicious people. They are from the great land village.

Rukias:
She is exhausted from attempting to perform the seal. Please let her rest.

Resistance Member:
Understood. Then, this way...

Iristelessa:
Yes...
The leader, Maxwell, should be inside. Please explain to him.

Yurii:
Yes.

(talk to doctor by Iristelessa)

Doctor:
Even with the Dragon Orb's power, Lady Iris' consciousness has not returned.

(check Iristelessa)

Doctor
She is extremely weakened.
She has lost consciousness rather than being asleep.
She is somehow holding out with the power of the Dragon Orb, if we didn't have it, it wouldn't be unusual for her to die.

(talk to merchant in top right room)

Merchant:
Welcome. What kind of goods may I sell to you...?
...I'm just acting as a merchant, but my work is actually gathering information.
Among my comrades I am called the disguise king.
Perhaps you'd really like to buy something?

Merklich:
1) Yes (*)
2) No

Disguise King:
Then, shall you go look?

Merklich:
1) Weapons
2) Armor
3) Gems
4) Goods
5) Sell

Disguise King:
See you later!

(talk to Resistance members if you want)

Resistance member in the storage room:
There are a lot of good stored, huh? These are sent to Resistance members in various places.

Resistance member by the center:
Maxwell put many terrorist groups in order and made a proper organization.
Surely it's not as vigorous as before but that's only for now. Someday eventually we will launch and make our debut.
When that happens then we will break the despotism of the Hingistan royal family. However if we just bring down royalty, then the country will be in confusion, and Fomeros could take advantage of it.
Therefore after Maxwell defeats the royal family, he is making a basis to govern the country without disorder.

Resistance member in top room, left one:
Maxwell's way is sluggish! We should stealthily get close to those guys and do them in with one blow!
Although,as an organization, damage to us can be reduced more than acting as terrorism disconnectedly.
However it's most important for us to make our purpose known! If we're closed up in a place like this, we can't do that!

Resistance member in top room, right one:
The ones who didn't do anything but only express dissatisfaction are already dead. I wonder how many of them will get involved?
Even so Maxwell says not to damage citizens at all costs. What a bother!

(talk to Resistance member in top left before Maxwell)

Resistance Member:
The leader is inside. It is fine if you are allies of the Shrine Maiden, but do not do anything strange.

(go inside room)

Wendy:
Maxwellart brother!

Maxwell:
...Who are you? Why did you call me that?

Wendy:
I'm Wendiana.

Maxwell:
Wendiana...?

Wendy:
Did you forget, brother? Certainly we didn't meet that much, but...

Maxwell:
No, I do remember.
But, why are you here? What happened to the castle?

Rukias:
Wendiana? Castle? Just what is this about?

Wendy:
Uh... it's...

Maxwell:
You didn't let them know?

Wendy:
...No...

Yurii:
Wendy, if possible, won't you tell us? We are your friends.

Wendy:
......
...Yes, that's right.
The truth is that I am from the Hingistan royal family.

Yurii:
Royal family? Then you are a princess?

Wendy:
I'm the third daughter of a noble concubine, so I have two elder sisters.

Rukias:
Why would a princess join Monopolis?

Maxwell:
...Is that because of me...?

Wendy:
Yes, brother.

Yurii:
Please wait a moment. If Wendy is a Hingistan princess, and Maxwell is her older brother...

Rukias:
He is Hingistan royal prince?
Why would a prince be leader of the Resistance?

Maxwell:
I want you keep the matter about me and Wendiana a secret. I don't even want to let the Resistance members know.
I am certainly Hingistan's second prince. So while I learned about the royal family's history, a certain suspicion grew.
Several hundred years ago, we saved the people from troubled times and the royal family prospered.
But the country grew larger, and the royal family gathered wealth and authority as if it were their right.
Moreover, to obtain more wealth, they imposed heavy taxes on the citizens.
I proposed to my father many times to stop it, but he would not listen to me.
Therefore I left the castle.

Rukias:
And then you created the Resistance for the sake of the country's citizens? But if that's so isn't it all right even if you reveal yourself?

1) Agree with Rukias
2) Don't agree (*)
3) Say nothing

Rukias:
Why is it?

Maxwell:
Certainly it would be fine if I was just going against the current king.
But with that then the same situation may occur.
Here and now it is better if the royal family was lost. For that sake, the victor of this revolution must be a citizen.

Rukias:
Therefore it is bad that Fomeros has interfered...

Maxwell:
That is how it is.

Wendy:
No... Then brother, you cannot return to the castle?

Maxwell:
I'm sorry, Wendiana. I will not return to the castle. And, the stage of revolution has not even appeared.

Wendy:
No... then... what should we do...

Yurii:
Sir Maxwell, can you at least listen to Wendy's story?

Maxwell:
Just to listen is fine.

Wendy:
The truth is, elder brother Gilliam has died in battle but it is still not public.

Maxwell:
What!? Brother?

Wendy:
Ever since you left the castle, father the king has been remarkably dejected and is now in a sickbed.
After that, the country's rule was by Gilliam and the prime minister Zafreed, but last year, at the time they headed to inspect the battleground...

Maxwell:
...The information I received was injured in battle, and is only in bed...
He was more skilled in fighting than I am. For him to... it can't be...

Wendy:
It's only natural for you to be suspicious. Father is also doubting Gilliam's cause of death.
However, more importantly another problem has risen.

Maxwell:
What is it?

Wendy:
From Gilliam's death, prime minister Zafreed has taken over all of the government, and further imposes heavy taxes on the citizens for his own benefit...

Maxwell:
Just as I thought, the recent heavy taxes are Zafreed's work!

Wendy:
That's not all. To reinforce his status he is going to urge marriage to my elder sister.
Already in the castle there are only people who support Zafreed.
So I fled out of the castle to entrust father's final wish to you.

Maxwell:
...So that's so...
I thought things would become better if brother's condition improved, but...

Wendiana, you informed me well.

Rukias:
And now, about the great land Shrine Maiden...

Maxwell:
Iris... If she returned here, that means she couldn't seal the Infinitor?

Rukias:
It looks like you already heard what supposed to happen.

Maxwell:
I was the one who took her from the village. I know all of it.

Rukias:
Then I have something I want to ask. I'm a survivor of that village.

Maxwell:
After I left the castle, I hid my identity and entered Monopolis company. At that time I had confidence in my strength.
Having hopes in my ability, I became assigned to a special force.
And then one time, I received an independent mission to search for the great land village.
I'll leave out small details of the story, but I found the whereabouts of the village and reported to Commander Brandole, but that time I realized the Commander's dangerous intentions.
Immediately before the attack on the village, I took the Shrine Maiden and fled from Monopolis.

1) Why didn't you tell the villagers?
2) Express understanding regarding Maxwell's actions (*)
3) Remain silent

Rukias:
But shouldn't you at least have informed the villagers?

Maxwell:
It took all my might to take Iris with me without being noticed by Monopolis. I myself was a target by Monopolis.
Nevertheless... I see. Do you have recollection of this, Brave Guard...?

Rukias:
Yes, when you took away the Shrine Maiden, the Brave Guard was there with you, right?

Maxwell:
After that several things happened.
Iris' Brave Guard was killed by Monopolis in order to save her and me.

Rukias:
Then, who is he?

Maxwell:
In the great land's village, there are many Brave Guards put to sleep in pods.
It seems to be an ancient technology, but the sleeping Brave Guards in there all have the same face.
It seems that for every Shrine Maiden, one Brave Guard is awoken from the pod.
When Monopolis attacked the village they probably took a pod back to their base, and awakened him from sleep.

Wendy:
Then, that Merklich didn't have memories before means that...
You didn't lose them, but didn't have any from the start?

1) Yes
2) No (*)

Wendy:
You should really have memories? If so then it wold be good if you can remember them!

Maxwell:
Well then, I must discuss the next actions to the others. I am sorry but we will talk again another day.
Please rest well today.

(talk to Maxwell)

Maxwell:
Her... How is Iris' condition?

1) Not good
2) No need to worry
3) If you're worried then you should go see her (*)

Maxwell:
Yes, I was of course going to see her. But, I have duties as a leader.
Iris would fulfill her mission even knowing that she would die.
Everyone here thinks she is a strong person.
But that is not the truth.
She doesn't have to think about other people as she stands before the fate of death.
Not liking to talk more than necessary, she even avoids looking at other people's faces.
Because I know that, I try not to come into contact with her as much as I can.
But, she lived and returned here.
That means she failed in her mission, but it's a fact that it ended up with her not throwing her life.
From here I think I will talk to her as much as I can. I want to bury the void.
Even for that, I have to settle this work quickly...
Until then, take care of Iris in my place.

(talk to Yurii)

Yurii:
It hasn't been that long since I met you, but it feels like I've been with you for a long time before.
It's just that many things have happened, right?

1) Agree (*)
2) It is going to continue
3) Remain silent

Yurii:
I knew that I was correct. I firmly believe that you are the hero of the legend passed down in the fairy world.
Please keep doing well from now on.

(talk to Wendy)

Wendy:
My secret is finally leaked. I entered Monopolis to go after my brother's whereabouts.
I knew that my brother entered Monopolis after leaving the castle.

1) How did you know that?
2) And that is why you admired the Red Wolf unit? (*)
3) Remain silent

Wendy:
Ah, you knew? Apparently my brother entered the Red Wolves.

Therefore I tried to investigate the records in the Monopolis data room but it was deleted, and I was at a critical stalemate.
But it ended up well. I met Maxwell.
With this my mission has also ended...

1) Are you going back to the castle? (*)
2) It's not over yet
3) Remain silent

Wendy:
The castle...? It's already been two years...
...But, I'm not going back... I still have things to do.
The Commander's... no, Infinitor's schemes must be stopped...

Speaking of which, we know your secret, but...
Being asleep the whole time, and all having the same face, I don't understand it at all.
No matter what, you are you. Keep doing well as you are from now.

(talk to Wendy again)

Wendy:
What's up?

1) Have you gotten better at cooking?
2) Would you like your brother to taste your cooking? (*)
3) Don't say anything

Wendy:
My cooking...? Well, we are reunited, but...
But it's too bad! I wasn't fussing over cooking for that objective.
At the time I left the castle to search for my brother, I had two attendants.
As you can see I'm alone now, but after I lost the funds, those two worked to earn money for me.
"We cannot let the princess work", is what they said, and everyday they came home tired and I couldn't do anything.
Therefore I should at least make hot food for them. That's why I got seriously into cooking.
But even now that I can cook, those two won't return any more...

1) I will eat it (*)
2) Let your brother eat it
3) Remain silent

Wendy:
Hey, you glutton!
I'm just kidding. Thank you, you're so kind.

(talk to Rukias)

Rukias:
It wasn't that the Shrine Maiden abandoned the village. I feel a little better.
Furthermore, we know about your real identity. I knew it, the culprit behind everything was Monopolis...

1) Agree
2) It's not the Monopolis but the Infinitor (*)
3) Remain silent

Rukias:
I see, that's certainly so. In other words Infinitor was the one directing all of this.

(talk to Iristelessa)

Iristelessa:
...Ugh...I'm sorry... At great pains, you...exchanged your life... to let me flee...

Resistance Member:
It seems she is mistaking you for someone else.
The one who exchanged his life is no longer in this world...

Iristelessa:
...I'm sorry.... my mission...

1) It's already over
2) Just rest for now (*)
3) Remain silent

Iristelessa:
I'm sorry.... Next time will absolutely...

(check the glowing ball on desk)

[There is a note placed on top of the table.
Will you record?]
1) Yes (*)
2) No

[Warning
From here there are no save points for a while, and there is danger that proceeding in the game may become difficult. Therefore it is recommended not to overwrite save data up to now with this save point.]

(rest on the bed)

[Sleep until next morning?]
1) Yes (*)
2) No

Man who looks like Merklich:
How are the preparations on your side?

Neilis:
The preparations of my troop are already finished. We can go at any time.

Man who looks like Merklich:
Fine.
As planned we will begin the assault operations!
If we kill the great land Shrine Maiden who is the humans' main power, they will lose their ground.

Neilis:
If we sever their unity, humans will become nothing but a disorderly crowd.

Man who looks like Merklich:
This planet belongs to Infinitor! Go!

Disguise King (merchant)
It's serious! Monopolis private soldiers!
We've got to run from here!

Wendy:
But how should we escape?

Disguise King:
Opposite of the normal exit, there is one more hidden path. Run from there!
I will bring the key. Get rid of the enemies as much as you can!
From that, this is a serious matter, but...

Wendy:
What?

Disguise King:
After I bring the key, don't forget this form.

Wendy:
You're going to stay like a merchant, right? Understood.

(talk to Maxwell)

Maxwell:
How did they find out this place...
No, now is not the time to talk about it.
Just care about yourselves and escape from here.

Wendy:
What about you?

Maxwell:
I have to deal with the matters here. Go ahead of us.

Rukias:
What will we do about the Shrine Maiden? She is still not conscious.

Maxwell:
I will do something about her. Now, hurry and escape!

(go up a ladder)

Resistance Member:
If they get through here then the other members will be in danger!

Resistance Member:
We know! We'll have to buy time!

Rukias:
It looks like a fair number has come into here... Then, it is impossible to go up.

Wendy:
That person said there is a hidden passage. Where could it be?

Rukias:
When that disguise king comes, we'll know.

======================================
MISSION BATTLE 23 Escape from Resistance Hideout

Resistance Member:
We will protect this passageway, so please take care of that one! Be careful not to let any enemy through!

(disguise king appears)

Disguise King:
I will open the hidden passage immediately. Please don't let enemies get in my way.

[[Clear Conditions

Game Over Conditions

(Monopolis soldiers appear from the water)

Monopolis Soldier:
I knew that the waterway would connect to here. It was worth bringing the diving tools.
All right, go to the lower floor!

(disguise king reaches top left panel)

Disguise King:
Hey!

Yurii:
He has opened the hidden exit.

[[Clear Conditions
- Guard this floor for a certain period of time

You guys too, this is enough! Go to the hidden exit! We will meet again if fate is good!

[[Clear Conditions
-Make all party members escape, Merklich escapes last

Game Over Conditions

(Wendy reaches exit)

Wendy:
I'll go ahead. Be careful!

(Rukias reaches exit)

Rukias:
I'll go ahead, so don't get killed!

(Merklich reaches exit)

Yurii:
All right, Sir Hero! We will go too!

(use the Transgate and reach center. go upstairs to top floor)

Resistance Member:
Damn... that man, he's really strong... as expected of a Red Wolf...

Wendy:
If it's Red Wolves, then it was Shuweizer's orders?

Resistance Member:
More importantly, because of him, the Shrine Maiden is...

Rukias:
What happened to the Shrine Maiden?

Resistance Member:
She was taken away...

Rukias:
The Shrine Maiden was captured!? Then the Dragon Orb too?

Resistance Member:
Yes, that is so...
At any rate we will have to contact other members...

Yurii:
If we don't rescue her soon it'll be serious!

Wendy:
If she was taken away from there, they must use the boat from Schizarz! Let's hurry!

(go to Transgate near Leystan and go to Schizarz)

Neilis:
Sensor in poor condition... switch to self repair mode...

Yurii:
Huh? Sir Hero, that's...

(talk to Neilis)

Neilis:
Who is it... Sorry but now my camera is in poor condition so I cannot see things clearly. Moreover my hearing sensor is also in poor condition.

Yurii:
(Sir Hero, this is certainly the enemy called Neilis. Apparently she cannot realize it now...
I will stay quiet for the time being.)

Neilis:
This sensation... I have met it before... Certainly it was on the sealed continent.
That reminds me that time my camera was also in poor condition and I couldn't see anything. This body in this state is extremely bothersome.
So, you also came to this continent? Then you are also related to Monopolis.
If so then it's convenient. Let me ask a few questions.
Do you know where Infi-- no, Commander Brandole is?

1) Monopolis headquarters (*)
2) I don't know

Neilis:
That was until one week ago. Now he is not there.

Because I am in such a state. I cannot be seen by company members who don't know the circumstances.
I will tell only you, but I am a soldier directly in the Commander's command. Isn't it great?
I have been serving that person since a very long time ago. So very long ago that it cannot be imagined by you.
Because I am in such a state, I can carry out missions that living flesh humans cannot.
Tasks that humans cannot do...  In spite of that I never received praise even once... Why is that?
I have seen him praise others who weren't given tasks greater than mine.
Even so, why don't I receive any praise? Is it because I am not a flesh human?
If you are a flesh human, then tell me! Why don't I receive any praise?

1) Because you failed at something (*)
2) Because the commander doesn't bother about such a thing
3) Only the commander knows

Neilis:
...As I thought, that was it... There is something that I haven't done.
If so, all the more, if I don't make an effort for that person...
Thank you. I am glad to have talked with you.
For my sake you took your time.
My self repairs will soon finish. Please go without worrying about me.

(go to Schizarz)

Yurii:
If we don't meet her as an enemy then she is not really a bad person.

(approach Hofman)

Hofman:
Ah, you guys. It's been a while.
Thank you very much for helping at that dangerous time.

Wendy:
Umm, who is this again?

Yurii:
Before, when we went to Jiant Mountain, we met Hofman who fought with us against the Fomeros army.

Hofman:
It's humbling to have fought with you. I'm the one who got help.

Wendy:
What do you mean?

Yurii:
History was changed, so that mountain didn't get shot by the Admonisher.
But we fought on that mountain with the Fomeros army, and it remains there inside history.

Rukias:
The fact that we fought Fomeros remains, but that cause was lost...

Yurii:
Yes. The resolution without contradiction is that we defended Hofman.

Wendy:
If we unskillfully change history, our knowledge will end up coming short.

Yurii:
Yes. This time was by chance a resolution without damage, but according to the situation innocent people may disappear from this world.

Hofman:
What's the matter?

Yurii:
Nothing, I am just explaining you to Wendy about you.

Hofman:
Is that so?
At any rate, recently it's been quite busy and confused.
The other day Monopolis private soldiers came here by boat and went somewhere...

Wendy:
So then when did the Monopolis soldiers return?

Hofman:
No, they haven't returned.
When the soldiers got off the boat, it immediately withdrew, and the soldiers had materials such as tents.
Considering the circumstances it doesn't look like they intend to return for a while.

Rukias:
If they haven't returned, then the Shrine Maiden is in a different place...

Hofman:
If it's all right, won't we talk inside the inn? I will pay the inn fee tonight.

(go to inn to rest)

Yurii:
...Sir Hero...I feel bad traces in the future. I think it would be better to record first.

(save game)

Hofman:
You are also from Monopolis?

1) Yes (*)
2) No

Wendy:
However, that was "former".

Hofman:
"Former"? I'm also now a "former" Fomeros soldier.
Most of all after I clear away my false accusations I want to go back immediately.

1) Offer to help him (*)
2) Ask if he has an objective to start with
3) Remain silent

Hofman:
Thank you for your support. But I have no objective to start with...
Now I'm just using all my might to protect myself as I gather information.

Yurii:
Speaking of which, Hofman, how did you go to Schizarz from Leystan?
If you collected information, then aren't there more Fomeros soldiers in Leystan?

Hofman:
Do you know that Hingistan has retaken Jiant Mountain?

Wendy:
That mountain? Is that true?

Hofman:
Yes. With that the Fomeros army greatly withdrew so I was able to go through without being found.
Intelligence gathering was convenient, but to be captured then it would be the end of everything.

Yurii:
Is that so.

Hofman:
At any rate, this village is nice. It's quiet and I like it.
Oh, did I talk too much? You all must be tired.
Innkeeper, please leave their lodge fee to me.

Innkeeper:
Yes, as you wish.

Wendy:
So then today we can have a little free time, right?
I will go out a bit!

Rukias:
Before even hearing everyone's response, she goes freely...

Yurii:
Please don't leave the village, all right?
What will we do?

(talk to Hofman)

Hofman:
I have one thing I want to ask, but you have traveled to various places, right? If I use the keywords "harbor" and "ship", do any other places come to mind outside of Schizarz village?

1) Makinus (*)
2) I can't answer
3) Ask the intention in this question

Yurii:
Monopolis headquarters in Makinus has a lot of ships.
What about it?

Hofman:
I was actually requested to look for someone.
After I fled from Leystan somehow... I tried coming to Schizarz which has a port.
I see.... Makinus, huh?
He said he was going overseas, so maybe it's there.

Yurii:
The person you're looking for is riding a boat?

Hofman:
It's a child I knew in Leystan, but his father seems to be a sailor.
I didn't get contact with them here so I'm worried.
If I could, I want to make sure he's safe...

1) Express admiration (*)
2) I'll root for you
3) Remain silent

Hofman:
No, it's not that big a deal.

(talk to Rukias)

Yurii:
Rukias, why are you going after that much strength?

Rukias:
Didn't I tell you before?
The people of the great land village work to protect the Shrine Maiden.
At that attack five years ago, I could only run...

Yurii:
However, it can't be helped considering your age five years ago...

1) Watch over his progress and growth silently
2) The real reason is what happened after the attack on the village (*)
3) Yell at him to tell the truth

Rukias:
...Ugh...

Yurii:
It looks like it's as Sir Hero thought.

Rukias:
...Tch! I know...
It was a little before the barrier on Goatland lifted...

Rukias:
...Damn it, I can't fight against them at all...

Lera:
It's scary, Rukias...

Rukias:
Don't be scared! I'll stop them here, so hurry and run!

Lera:
B-but, Rukias...

Rukias:
Go quickly! If you can run, then the soldiers at the bridge can help us!

Lera:
O, okay! I'll come call the soldier!

Rukias:
Stop!
...I don't think I can hold out until then...
Aagghh!

Rukias:
I'm... alive...
...haha... I'm saved...
...Huh, Lera!?
Lera! Lera!!

Hingistan Soldier:
You can't go! You can't see it!

Rukias:
Let me go! What happened to Lera!

Hingistan Soldier:
She got killed by monsters. You'd better not look!
Hey!

Rukias:
Lera! ...Lera?
...Ugh... ugh...Aaaagghh!!

Rukias:
There were the remains of Lera who had been fed upon...

Yurii:
......

Rukias:
If I had more strength that time, at least ten minutes more and not let the monsters run... Lera would have been saved.
I don't want to feel that a second time. So I want to get strong...

Yurii:
I am sorry. We made you recall a painful experience...

Rukias:
...It's fine. Even if I don't recall it, I see it in a dream every night...
But, even if you feel bad, won't you leave me alone a while...?

(go to Wendy)

Wendy:
...Is that so? Ah, this, it's always...

Woman:
My, I'm sorry...

Wendy:
No, please don't worry. It is thanks for having his funeral.
Then, I will excuse myself...

Child:
Say, mother. What is a funeral?

Woman:
It's to hold a burial.

Child:
A burial, for dead people? Why do we have a funeral if he's still living?

Woman:
Children do not have to know.

(talk to boy)

Child:
You are with her, right?
Why is there a funeral if he's still alive?

Yurii:
To answer that, we need to have you tell us more details.

Child:
Umm, since a long time ago, that big sister was troubled about the injured uncle.
She was hurried, so he's only injured and staying in my house.
And so the uncle became healthy and went out somewhere, but... my mother said he died.
That big sister thinks that the uncle is dead, so did she give money for the funeral...?

1) I'll tell her the truth (*)
2) There are adults' issues
3) Only the persons involved know what's going on

Child:
Then, big brother will tell big sister!

(talk to Wendy)

Wendy:
The ocean is nice... but I hate boats...

1) Agree
2) Disagree
3) Tell her what the boy said (*)

Wendy:
Huh? What's this about?

Yurii:
The truth is...

Wendy:
No way... Beckel is still living...
I will go ask why!

Wendy:
Excuse me!

Woman:
Yes, is there something again?

Wendy:
Um, is it true that Beckel is still living?

Woman:
What?

Wendy:
Please tell me the truth!

Woman:
...I'm sorry. I was actually requested by Beckel to lie...

Wendy:
Then, he is alive! ...Thank goodness...
So, where is he?

Woman:
I don't know that much. I was just requested that he wanted to make it like he died.

Wendy:
Is that so... Just what could he be doing...

Woman:
Um... the money...

Wendy:
Please keep it. You had to take care of him until he healed.

Woman:
I am very sorry to have lied to you, even if that was requested of me.

(talk to Wendy)

Wendy:
I explained before that I am from the Hingistan royal family, right?
When I left the castle to search for my brother, I had two attendants. Beckel was one of them.
He got injured and remained here, and after I entered Monopolis and immediately returned here, I was told that he died.
I don't know why he wanted to say that, but he is alive so now just that is good enough.

(knock on purple door left of arms shop)

Old man:
Oh, you are traveling with a fairy? Then you are fighting to save the world, just like the Growlanser.
You haven't heard of it? Recently it's a tale that is dying out.
When I was a child it was usually talked about, but recently it has died out...

Yurii:
Will you tell us more about that story?

Old man:
There was a man from a certain country with different colored eyes. He received a prophecy that in his future he would either save the world or destroy the world.
And so the country's famous sorceress sent a fairy in order to look after him.
He went on travel, met many allies, splendidly overturned fates imposed on him, and led the world to peace.

Yurii:
And then, what happened to that hero?

Old man:
The truth is that there a couple of ways it ended.
Going with one of his friends, going after a different world, and marrying a woman knight of the neighboring country.
Yes, there is also an ending where he marries his fairy.

Yurii:
The fairy and the hero were married?

Old man:
The fairy requested the sorceress to make her human, and she married the hero... isn't it? At any rate, there are several ways it ended.
When I was a child, we would all talk lively about the ending we liked...

Yurii:
So there is such a story... Is there a way to know more about this story?

Old man:
It's not sold any more, but you can only look for old books.

Yurii:
I see, it's a little unfortunate. Thank you very much.

(talk to innkeeper)

Innkeeper:
I received tonight's payment from that person. Will you rest now?

Merklich:
1) Rest (*)
2) Don't rest
3) Save
4) Summon Yurii

(go outside)

Village Chief:
What is this!?

Fomeros Army Captain:
Be quiet! We are from the Fomeros army!
We are going to draft this village as a front line base! Leave it quietly!

Man:
Don't be ridiculous! Don't take light of ocean men!
To say nothing of Hingistan, why would we hand over this village to Fomeros!?

Man:
That's right! You are the ones who should leave!

Hofman:
It's noisy out here, what's the matter?

Yurii:
Ah, Hofman. They are...

Hofman:
Hm? Fomeros army? Could they be pursuing me?

Yurii:
No, they want to make this village a base, and they ordered to vacate it...

Hofman:
What?

Fomeros  Army Captain:
If we don't attack the giant here that Hingistan is using, then it will penetrate up to Fomeros country!

Village Chief:
Why do we, who are Hingistan's citizens, have to help Fomeros!?

Fomeros  Army Captain:
So you're going to stand here 'til the last? Then we will just have to take it by force!
Begin the oppression tactics!

Hofman:
...What is this...! We have to protect this village!

Rukias:
Then let's cooperate.
Is that fine?

1) Yes (*)
2) No

Hofman:
I will join your team. Please give instructions.

[Hofman joined your party!]

Fomeros Soldier:
If we kill one or two people, then they should obey us!

Hofman:
To behave like that in a different country... is that what Fomeros soldiers say!?

Fomeros Soldier:
What? Do you want to die first?

[In upper right of screen the meter displays the villagers' mental state. If their morale becomes too bad they will surrender, so please be careful.]

======================================
MISSION BATTLE 24 Prevent Fomeros from Building a Base

- Drive away the Fomeros soldiers

Game Over Conditions
- Death of village chief
- Villagers surrender
- All party members defeated]]

Complete: No villager casualties, morale gauge doesn't reach 3/5
Clear: No villager casualties, but morale gauge reaches 3/5

======================================

(after killing most of the soldiers)

Fomeros Army Captain:
These guys are strong! Just who are you?

Wendy:
Don't make light of the power of the Red Wolves!

Fomeros Army Captain:
The Red Wolf force!? Monopolis' special troop!?
Kuh! I can't have any more damage than this!
All members, retreat!

(after battle)

Hofman:
Whew, looks like we did it.

Village Chief:
Ohh, thank you very much! Because of you we are saved.

Wendy:
The Fomeros solders said they would make this a base. Then, this area will become a war?

Village Chief:
They said something about fighting a giant here...

Rukias:
Giant? ...Then, that thing...?

Wendy:
If the giant is destroyed in battle...

Yurii:
We prevented the small country alliance from being annihilated...

1) Suggest to stop the giant (*)
2) Ask for everyone's suggestions
3) Remain silent

Rukias:
That way seems good. If they bring out a weapon in line with the Admonisher then it will become impossible to restore two countries.

Hofman:
I don't understand what you're talking about well, but if we're going to stop the giant, we'd better hurry.
Fomeros army was going to make this a defense position, which means that we can think that it still hasn't left Jiant Mountain or that it has just come out.
If it's in that area then people can't live there. To stop the giant without getting people involved, then only now is the time.
Of course, if we're going to do it then I will help you.

Wendy:
Hofman!

Hofman:
It's regrettable but this is not only sense of justice.
The giant will probably head to Fomeros first.
To save my homeland, I want to stop the giant personally.

1) The more people help, the better
2) The more people with same convictions, the better (*)
3) Refuse his offer

Yurii:
Yes. Those who protect have something to protect are strong.

Rukias:
Then, let's depart after we are prepared.

(exit village and go west 2 maps)

Hofman:
It's here. So that is the Hingistan giant...

Rukias:
It's awfully huge...

Wendy:
It looks like the soldiers are currently resting. Let's attack in one stroke.
Inside there should be a place to control the giant, so if we go there we can seize the controls.

Hofman:
If the giant begins to move then there's no other way to stop it. Now is the time to fight!

Yurii:
Everyone, please be careful!

======================================
MISSION BATTLE 25 Penetrate the Ancient Giant
[[Clear Conditions
- All enemies defeated

Game Over Conditions

--------------------------------------
Complete: Clear in 110 seconds
Clear: Clear within 133 seconds
Failed: Clear in 134 or more seconds
======================================

Hofman:
Oh? Apparently part of the troop is moving.

Yurii:
Is that so?

Hofman:
It seems they are preparing to march. If we hide somewhere maybe they can pass us.
But then if the giant moves while we wait and then all will be lost. We don't know when it will move.
I will leave it to you where we should hide.

(hide behind tree)

Hingistan Soldier:
All right, all troops begin to move. Do not disarrange the lines.

Hingistan Soldier:
Well then, shall we go at leisure?

Hingistan Soldier:
Hey, go in proper manner.

Hingistan Soldier:
The captain can't see from there.
At any rate we have the giant, so we don't need to act too diligently.

Hingistan Soldier:
That's also true...

(after the group of soldiers march away, get closer to giant)

Hingistan Soldier:
Captain, enemies here!

Hingistan Army Captain:
What!
They don't know their own place with just four people!
All troops, engage them!

Hingistan Soldier:
Yes sir!

Hingistan Army Captain:
Huh? That woman...
...This is bad...

Wendy:
Huh, he is... no way, Beckel?
But I can't see well from here.
Hey, Merklich! I want to make sure if he's Beckel!
Please back me so I can get close over there!

(kill a few soldiers or come close to giant)

Hingistan Army Captain:
What's the meaning of this? At this rate they'll get to the giant...
I will go send word inside! You guys buy time as much as you can!

[[Clear Conditions
- All enemies defeated

Game Over Conditions
- Army captain reaches the giant
- Party annihilated
- Giant begins to move]]

(move Wendy near captain)

Wendy:
It is Beckel! So you really are alive!

Hingistan Army Captain:
Lady Wendiana...That you are alive is...

Wendy:
What are you saying?

Hingistan Army Captain:
You didn't hear from Meine? ...Then this is convenient!
You guys, kill this woman here!

Wendy:
Beckel!?

(Wendy attacks Beckel)

Wendy:
Tell me, Beckel! Just what happened!

Hingistan Army Captain:
I do not talk to dead people! If you want to know, then you can get it out of me by force!

Wendy:
...Ugh! ...Is this the only way...?

(defeat Beckel)

Hingistan Army Captain:
...D-damn it...

[[Clear Conditions
- All enemies defeated

Game Over Conditions
- All party members defeated
- Giant begins to move]]

Wendy:
...What in the world is this about? What does Meine know?
...No, I'll have to worry about it later! Now we have to do something about the giant!

(after battle)

Yurii:
You did it! But, we still cannot relax. We have to go in the giant and stop it quickly!

Wendy:
Yes, understood! Well, let's hurry!

(enter the giant)

Maintenance Staff:
Agh! Invaders!

Hingistan Soldier:
Stop the power to the elevator, and hide in the storehouse!

Maintenance Staff:
Y-yes!

(after a bit)

Maintenance Staff:
Cough cough, this room is extremely dusty.

Maintenance Staff:
The ventilation device is stopped. We can't use it.

Maintenance Staff:
It should be okay if it's other than the elevator switch.

Maintenance Staff:
All right, recover part of the power... damn!
The ventilation switch is outside this room!

Maintenance Staff:
What! Cough cough!

(defeat all soldiers and use the switch in top left)

[There is a ventilation device. Will you operate it?]
1) Yes (*)
2) No

Maintenance Staff:
Ah, the ventilation is on. Where did the intruders go?

(go to right room)

Maintenance Staff:
Uhh, it's noisy... I can't sleep.
Wh-what! What happened?!

(enter top right room)

Rukias:
We don't have a lot of time, but we can't rush and fail either.
It may be better to rest a little bit.

Maintenance Staff:
Wha, what are you! Help me!

Yurii:
We are not going to hurt you. We just want you to tell us how to go up.

Maintenance Staff:
...Okay. If you have this card you can pass the locked door here.

+Obtained ID Card A!+

(rest on bed)

Yurii:
Sir Hero...
When we fought outside, it seems that enemy soldier and Wendy knew each other...

1) I'm not interested
2) I'll ask Wendy about it (*)

Yurii:
Yes.
Wendy! We'd like to talk a little.

Wendy:
What?

Yurii:
That enemy a while ago...

Wendy:
Oh... Yes, I'll tell you as we rest.
He is one of the attendants with me when I left the castle, Beckel.
The other person was Meine.
Beckel was injured and returned, and told me this.
"Meine has betrayed us! She usurped the funds!"
"I knew when I saw it, and I immediately cut her down!"
"If you don't hurry and run, Wendy will also be in danger!"

Yurii:
And then he ran to Schizarz village?

Wendy:
I left the injured Beckel in the care of that house, and I went to Makinus.
But Beckel who I thought died still lived, and was going to kill me...
Just what exactly happened?

1) He didn't want to let you know that he's alive
2) Beckel is the one who embezzled the army funds (*)
3) I don't know

Yurii:
That is a possibility.
He laid the blame on Meine and made it like he died.
Doing that he could take all the money...

Wendy:
If that's so, then Meine... I wonder what happened to her?

Yurii:
Where did you part with Meine?

Wendy:
If I remember right that time I was in Leystan...
But it was already more than one year ago and I've been to Leystan many times...

Yurii:
Then she must have moved to another place...

Wendy:
Then I can't follow any tracks.
More importantly now we have to concentrate on stopping the giant!

(check the elevator switch)

[There is a switchboard. Will you restore elevator's power?]
1) Yes (*)
2) No


(talk to merchant)
Merchant:
Ack! Who are you guys! You're not Hingistan army!

Yurii:
Why are you here?

Merchant:
I am a merchant contracted to Hingistan army. The goods here are my products!
Even if you're not from Hingistan army, I will sell goods so please just spare my life!
Then, please have a look.

Merklich:
1) Weapons
2) Armor
3) Gems
4) Goods
5) Sell

(use elevator)

Hingistan Army Captain:
From now we will perform preparations for the magic cannon's firing! All members stand your posts!

Wendy:
It's serious, they intend to fire! We have to stop them quickly!

[[Clear Conditions
- Cancel the main cannon's firing status and head to the cockpit

Yurii:
Sir Hero, I feel a great magic power from those glowing things! They might be the power source for the magic cannon!

(Merklich gets near glowing pillar)

Yurii:
As I thought this seems to supply energy to the main cannon.

[There is an energy supply device. Will you stop the energy supply?]
1) Yes (*)
2) No

[Announcer
Righthand supply unit is stopped. Right cannon tower's energy supply rate will decline.]

Hingistan Soldier:
What happened to the right supply unit?

(soldier comes out of room)

Hingistan Soldier:
Intruders! Operate the golems to remove them immediately!

Hingistan Soldier:
Golems, deal with the intruders!

(another character gets near other pillar)

[There is an energy supply device. Will you stop the energy supply?]
1) Yes (*)
2) No

[Announcer:
Lefthand supply unit is stopped. Left cannon tower's energy supply rate will decline.]

Hingistan Soldier:
Huh? The left supply unit is stopped?
At this rate we can't activate the cannon as planned. It can't be helped, I'll go look at the situation.

Hingistan Soldier:
What the hell!? Damn it, operate the golems to attack them!

Hingistan Soldier:
Golems startup! Engage the enemy!

(kill the soldier who was in left room)

[There was a sound like a small metal item dropped on the floor!]

(check the right switch)

Yurii:
This looks like the firing device. Let's call off the firing status.

[Will you stop the cannon?]
1) Yes (*)
2) No

Yurii:
Apparently there are multiple main cannon control systems. Let's gain control of the cockpit quickly.

+Head control center+

Hingistan Army Captain:
Kuh! They've been able to penetrate this far!

Rukias:
The control room, huh? If we take this then it will be the end.

Hofman:
That's right.

Hingistan Soldier:
Captain! Intruders are coming from afar!

Hingistan Soldier:
They are... Monopolis private army...!?

Hingistan Army Captain:
What!? Comrades of those guys!?
Prepare main cannon fire!

Hingistan Soldier:
Is it all right? The cannon's shot is aimed above Schizarz village!

Hingistan Army Captain:
It cannot be helped! We can't have this taken away!

Hingistan Soldier:
Uh-understood!

Hingistan Army Captain:
Remaining troops, remove the intruders!

Yurii:
Now, if they shoot the Monopolis private army...

Wendy:
We can't let Schizarz be victimized!

It looks like this will disable the barrier.

[There is a barrier control device. Will you operate it?]
1) Yes (*)
2) No

Yurii:
The barrier is released. Everyone, let's proceed.

Hingistan Soldier:
The barrier has been released. Activate the barrier!

Hofman:
They have a barrier control on that side! If we don't be careful, the isolated person could be in danger.

(after battle)

Yurii:
You did well. The giant's control is complete.

Wendy:
But we can't relax yet. Monopolis private soldiers came here, right?

Rukias:
They were most likely aiming for the giant.

Hofman:
Now we'll have to defend it from the attack side.
Then, let's prepare our defense right away.

Wendy:
Hold it! Before that, we have to remove the master control key!

(check the control panel where you put the key)

Wendy:
If we remove this...

+Obtained Master Control Key!+

Wendy:
Now it can't move any time soon.
However if it's recovered by Monopolis then they'll surely find a way to operate it.

Rukias:
So we can't stop worrying about it.

(go down into save point room)

Rukias:
Are there more battles outside?
We don't have a lot of time but will we rest a little?

(exit the giant)

Hofman:
Let's prepare for battle until the enemy appears.

Rukias:
Well, we only have four people.

Hofman:
Because we have four people it's important to be thorough.

(walk out a little)

Shuweizer:
Ho, since it appears that the Hingistan army didn't come to meet us here, then you people must have seized control. That is quite convenient.

Wendy:
As expected, it's Shuweizer and the Red Wolf troop.

Shuweizer:
Since it's you people, I don't believe you'd hand it over quietly if I asked. Then, I will just have to take it by force.
Hey, it is your turn, Iristelessa!

Iristelessa:
......

Rukias:
The Shrine Maiden... This time she's become a subordinate of the corporation!?

Iristelessa:
If I don't do this, that person will...

Shuweizer:
I don't want any excessive talk! You use the Dragon Orb and activate the giant!

Wendy:
With the Dragon Orb!? No way, that's...

Shuweizer:
It's quite possible, the great land Shrine Maiden is using it herself!
Iristelessa, use the Dragon Orb and move the giant! Remaining troops remove the intruders in our way, and get control of the giant!

Wendy:
Iris... is this the only way...?

======================================
MISSION BATTLE 27 Iristelessa's Affliction
[[Clear Conditions
- Defeat Iristelessa

Game Over Conditions:

--------------------------------------
Complete: Defeated 12 or more enemies
Clear: Defeated 6 or more enemies
Failed: Defeated 5 or less enemies
======================================

Rukias:
...By the way, when this battle ends, what will happen to the giant...?

Wendy:
We will have to leave it if it moves.

Rukias:
Although the control key is disconnected, it'll be dangerious if it's recovered?

Hofman:
For that purpose, we have to completely drive off the Monopolis private army!

Rukias:
Then we'll have to fight hard so that they won't return here!

(after a while)

Hofman:
The enemy's number is great! Be careful so they they don't get inside the giant!

Wendy:
Not only that, we have to stop Iristelessa from taking control of it!

Rukias:
Damn it, what a bother!

(after a while)

Shuweizer:
You're still not finished?

Iristelessa:
I'm sorry... Give me a little more time...

Shuweizer:
The Dragon Orb didn't work on the tower my old man made. All that's left is to take the giant!

Iristelessa:
I understand. But I can only take control by the Dragon Orb once.
If it fails, the magic circuits can't endure a second time and I can't do the same method again.

Shuweizer:
Then concentrate and don't fail!

(defeat Iristelessa)

Iristelessa:
Ugh... any more than this is...

Shuweizer:
Damn it! You failed!
Now that taking control of the giant has failed, we can't let the Shrine Maiden die! Retreat from here!

(after battle)

Yurii:
You worked hard... But this is not a really good aftertaste.

Wendy:
Iris... she was troubled over something.
She must have had a reason to do such a thing...

1) Someone has been taken hostage (*)
2) She is just being threatened
3) Unknown reason

Yurii:
Speaking of which, she did say "that person".

Wendy:
If it's a hostage for Iris, it must be my brother...

Yurii:
That possibility is quite high.

Wendy:
...Brother...

Rukias:
That reminds me, Shuweizer said something that worries me.

1) There's only one chance to take the Giant
2) The Dragon Orb can't be used on his father's tower (*)
3) I don't remember

Rukias:
Yes, that was it!
His old man is commander Brandole, isn't it? In other words, this becomes act of the Infinitor.

Hofman:
What exactly are you talking about? Who is this "Infinitor"?

Yurii:
If we tell you suddenly it may surprise you, but the truth is that...
...And that is the matter now.

Hofman:
Hmm. That's an unbelievable story.
But I can feel conviction in your actions. That's perhaps the best proof.

Wendy:
Then, what will we do from here? Although they failed at controlling the giant, they have Iris and the Dragon Orb on that side.

Yurii:
It looks like the Shrine Maiden is coerced into obeying Shuweizer because of that hostage.

Wendy:
Brother...

Yurii:
Then if we find him and rescue him, then Iristelessa will be released from obeying Shuweizer.

Rukias:
The problem now is where is he held. We'll have to search for information.

2) Yarstill barracks seems suspicious (*)
3) Gather information in Leystan
4) To be sure, let's head to Makinus

Yurii:
Then let us depart.

(go east, north to Leystan)

Yurii:
There are many soldiers.

Hofman:
Are they on lookout or on a search...
Either way it looks like something happened to the Fomeros army stationed in Leystan.

(go near Leystan entrance)

Fomeros Soldier:
Hey, you there, halt!
Currently we're on special alert! Show your proof of identity!

(select モノポリス社社員証)

Fomeros Soldier:
Monopolis members, huh?
You may pass.

Wendy:
There are even lots of soldiers in town. I wonder what happened?

Man:
You're unfamiliar faces, so you must be travelers?

Wendy:
Yes. What exactly is going on? When we came here before it wasn't like this.

Man:
In the city a building that the soldiers were using was exploded by someone. So now it's under strict alert.

Wendy:
A building exploded!?

Man:
From what I heard, it's because the anti-government army's order was lost.
So the radical faction wanted to quickly drive out the Fomeros army and had the military building explode.
Certainly we wanted to have the Fomeros army leave, but if only we did something sooner...
At any rate, if you're going to stay in this city, be careful so that you don't get swallowed up in the mess.

Rukias:
The terrorists are back... So now the soldiers are in alert.

Yurii:
It's because Maxwell is gone that it's become like this...

1) Let's hurry and save him
2) It should be easy to get information in this town (*)
3) Remain silent

Rukias:
That's right. If this city became a target of the terrorists it mean there must be people related here.
Since this city is a terrorist target, then the soldiers must be desperately getting information.
There should be more clues than we think in this city.

Hofman:
If so then it would be more efficient to split up to gather information than all go together.
How about we meet at the inn at evening?

Wendy:
Okay. Then, inn at night!

Hofman:
I cannot be captured by Fomeros army so I will get information inside the inn.

(talk to merchant by cart)

Merchant:
How about some delicious sweets?

Yurii:
Huh...? This person is certainly...

Disguise King:
(Ah, I've been noticed, huh? It's been a while.)

Yurii:
It is great that you are also safe. Actually, we are...

Disguise King:
(I know. Please pass this to the inn's owner.)

+Obtained Coin-Shaped Chocolate!+

Disguise King:
(You should be able to get some beneficial information.)
How about some delicious sweets?

(talk to Wendy)

Wendy:
Work hard to find something, okay?

[Will you tell her that you have a clue?]
1) Yes (*)
2) No

Wendy:
Oh, you found a lead?

(talk to Rukias)

Rukias:
You get some information too.

[Will you tell him that you have a clue?]
1) Yes (*)
2) No

Rukias:
You got a lead?

(enter inn)

Mira:
I've finally reached you...

Yurii:
Mira! What is the matter?
You must be exhausted from performing that spell.

Mira:
...It's more important than my body... A matter happened that I must tell you.
Time is flowing in a bad direction... If it keeps going this way, this planet will be extinguished.

Yurii:
A vision of extinguishment... It can't be...

Mira:
One person of your blood relative will become the key to this flow.
Somehow because he has been lost, history has turned dire in one stroke.

Yurii:
That person, it must be...

Wendy:
Is it my brother?

Mira:
Yes.
Do whatever is necessary. You must absolutely rescue him.
If it can't be done... this planet... will end...

Yurii:
Yes, your warning will not be in vain!

Mira:
...I will leave it to you...

(talk to Hofman)

Hofman:
Although it's to control the terrorists, the Fomeros army is taking quite vigorous means.
Thanks to that the dispute with the citizens looks like it won't end.
Before there was a person who moved to revoluation and dealt with the terrorists...
A revolution is necessary for the sake of Hingistan, but it doesn't look like it can come true in this state.
As expected, a charismatic leader is needed for revolution.

[Will you tell him that you have a clue?]
1) Yes (*)
2) No

Hofman:
You got a lead?

(show chocolate coin to innkeeper, 硬貨型チョコレート)

Innkeeper:
Oh, what a delicious-looking chocolate! Thank you very much.
As thanks, I will take you here.

Yurii:
Ah, are you the one that will give us information?

Doctor:
Yes. The Resistance leader, Maxwell's whereabouts have been found out.

Wendy:
Where is it? My brother...

Doctor:
Yarstill prison. But... it seems to be too late.

Wendy:
What happened?

Doctor:
He wouldn't allow himself to be questioned, and a few days ago committed suicide. I got word this morning.

Wendy:
No! ...Brother...

Rukias:
Suicide, is that true? How did you know that?

Doctor:
I am now a member of the Resistance, but formerly I worked for Monopolis. I have connections with an acquaintance of that time who is in management, and I obtained such information.

Hofman:
Even so what will we do now? The Shrine Maiden has lost the hostage, but now the revolution will fail!
Moreover, didn't the fairy at the inn's reception say so?
If he is lost, then this world will end.

Wendy:
Yurii, can we not travel through time once more?

Yurii:
It's unfortunate, but impossible.
In order to send us to the past, Mira and the others have used a lot of power. If they do it one more time, their lives are...

Wendy:
But if my brother is lost, then the world is headed to ruin!
Therefore, we have to return the time somehow!

Doctor:
The time...?
Umm, I don't know if this will be useful, but...

Rukias:
What is it?

Doctor:
I've heard that Shuweizer received an operation that lets him pass through time.

Wendy:
Is that true?

Doctor:
He received an operation, but there is a girl who had that operation first.

Rukias:
Where is she?

Doctor:
Lennox Research Center.

Wendy:
That's the place where I first met you.
But it's a Monopolis facility...

1) It's dangerous to go there
2) We have no choice but to go there (*)

Rukias:
That's the only way.

Wendy:
Then we'll have to hope that woman cooperates with us.

Hofman:
...Uhh, I'm sorry but, I don't quite understand...

Yurii:
How can we explain well? If we influence the past, then we could change the present...

Hofman:
I don't understand well, but this is Monopolis technology..?

Doctor:
Um, I'm interrupting your conversation, but we must prepare a new hideout. May I ask someone for help?

Hofman:
Then I will go. I don't understand this time thing no matter how they explain it to me.

Doctor:
If we finish preparations I will send a messenger.

Wendy:
Then, we will head to Lennox Research Center.

Rukias:
Where is that research center?

Wendy:
From Leystan, it is north immediately when we enter Jewarl country.

(exit Leystan, go north, and east)

Girl:
Big sister...

Boy:
It's scary!

Neilis:
It is all right. Do not worry.
I will protect you...

Wendy:
Huh? That's Neilis?

Rukias:
(Tch! Again in this place...!)

Yurii:
The children are in danger!

Neilis:
If you didn't lend your hand to that many monsters...

Girl:
Thank you, big sister!

Boy:
Thank you!

Neilis:
It's not that I wanted you to say thanks that I helped you... I...
...Yes! I just wanted to fight!
I am a weapon! I'm a weapon so it's only natural that I fight, right?

Boy:
But you helped us!

Girl:
For us!

Neilis:
...Uh... uhh...

Man:
Oh, hey! You guys!

Boy:
Ah, it's papa!

Girl:
Papa!

Neilis:
...Thank you... huh?
No, to be told such a thing is...
......
In deference to those children, I will overlook today.
But next time we meet I will be an enemy...

Neilis:
Is Neilis really a weapon?

1) She's just fighting for her mission
2) In reality she has a human heart (*)
3) There are other times this happened
4) Don't answer

Yurii:
I see. If only we could understand it...

(walk up)

Yurii:
Huh, that's... Sir Hero, can you see it?
It's small but there's no mistaking it. A time distortion.
But there isn't anything to change the flow of time with this.
It is rather a distortion born from a desire to change the past.
We will have to investigate more details to understand more...

(check the distortion)

Yurii:
This distortion is made from Rukias.

Rukias:
Me?
That reminds me, at this place, Lera...

Yurii:
It seems you created a distortion from intense desire to change the past.
Perhaps because you talked about that event to Sir Hero that the feeling of regret has enlarged.

Rukias:
Then, can we return to that time with this?

Yurii:
However it cannot be used now. It must become bigger...
More importantly, we should probably stick to our task at hand right now.

Rukias:
......

(go north, talk to soldier)

Fomeros Soldier:
From here it's Jewarl country. You will need proof of identity to pass.

(select モノポリス社社員証)

Fomeros Soldier:
You may pass.

(go north)

Rukias:
Is this Lennox Research Center?

Wendy:
Yes. This is where Merklich and I met.

Rukias:
Then how will we get in? There are many guard members.
Certainly they won't let us by just showing your ID?

Wendy:
If we could it would be easy, but of course that won't work.

Yurii:
Then what shall we do?

1) All attack and penetrate
2) Have two persons stay here to lure enemies (*)
3) Return for now and get prepared

Wendy:
That seems to be the best strategy.
Rukias and I will pull the attention of the enemies, and you and Yurii sneak inside!

Yurii:
If we can use the shade well, we should be able to get close to the gate without being seen.

Wendy:
Then we will keep the attention of the guards.

Rukias:
Then give us instructions so that you can sneak in easily.

Rukias:
Sorry but you're going to let us pass!

Monopolis Soldier:
What! Terrorists, huh!
Enemy attack! Call to battle!

Wendy:
Let's go!

(you will have to have the archers at the gate killed. Merklich can still use support magic and items on party)

(Merklich reaches gate)

Yurii:
All right, let's fulfill our objective while they hold out!

Yurii:
We got inside well.
Then let's look for the woman who had the operation before the enemy finds us.

1) I don't know where she is
2) I know where she is (*)
3) Remain silent

Yurii:
Is that so? Then that's reassuring!

[[Clear Conditions

(go into upper right room and talk to doctor)

Doctor:
Hi, I remember you.
I was also told by Anita. So, that time has come?

Yurii:
What did she say?

Doctor:
Eventually, a man who received the time operation will come. At that time he would take her and they'll work together.

Yurii:
So she will cooperate?

Doctor:
As a person, Anita opposes humans being used in experiments.
After being taken from here she wants to live peacefully.
But you are going to make her use that power. Just that is...

Yurii:
We need that person's power of surpassing time.

Doctor:
The operation performed on Anita was before it was perfect, so this medicine is required when using the ability to go through time.
That ability takes a large toll on her body. This medicine decreases that burden, I want you not to use that ability as much as possible.
Considering her physical strength, one more time is the limit. If you want to use that power a second time...
...Her life cannot be guaranteed...

Yurii:
Understood. For her sake we will not waste that power.

Doctor:
I'll leave it to you, this is the key to the cell.

+Obtained Prison Key!+

Doctor:
Now then, here's the medicine to lessen the burden. To be safe I will give you all that is left.

+Obtained Time Travel Medicine!+

Doctor:
If possible I want you to not use it.
This is all I can do. Well, hurry before the soldiers come back.

Yurii:
Yes.

(go into other building, top right door. go to Anita)

Anita:
It has been a while.
Just as I predicted, you came back for me.
Did you remember who I am?

1) Yes
2) No (*)

Anita:
...I see. You still can't remember me...
That is sad, but I will introduce myself. I am Anita.
And the fairy is?

Yurii:
I am traveling with Sir Hero. I am Yurii. Nice to meet you.

Anita:
Nice to meet you, Yurii.

Yurii:
Are you not surprised that we came?

Anita:
I foresaw that you would come...

Yurii:
Then do you also know the reason we came?

Anita:
Yes. You are going to stop my father Brandole. For that you need my power.
This is probably fate. I am already prepared. Please open the cell.

(use prison key, 牢のカギ)

Anita:
Then, let us go.
We cannot let the world be ruined.

[Anita has become an ally!]

(leave the room)

Anita:
I know that you don't remember me, but did any other memories return?

1) No (*)
2) Yes
3) Stay silent

Anita:
...Is that so. That's unfortunate.

Yurii:
Is Anita an acquaintance of Sir Hero?

Anita:
Yes. It was only for ten days, but...
More importantly, let's consider how to get out of here.

(exit the building and leave the map bottom left)

Monopolis Captain:
Damn it, where did they hide?

Yurii:
The two others have not been caught. Then, let us escape too.

Anita:
There are probably soldiers that know my face. Please be careful.

Yurii:
I see.
If Shuweizer finds that Anita has been taken away it may become troublesome.
We should not get Anita close to the soldiers as much as possible.

(got found)

Monopolis Soldier:
There you are!

Yurii:
We got seen...
If we escape individually we will become separated. Let's flee to the same direction.

======================================
MISSION BATTLE 30 Reunion with Anita
[[Clear Conditions
- Merklich escapes after party members escape (All members must escape in same direction)

Game Over Conditions
- Any party member defeated]]
--------------------------------------
Complete: Fulfill the clear conditions
Clear: ---
Failed: ---
======================================

Monopolis Soldier
There you are!

Yurii:
Everyone...

Wendy:
Welcome back, Merklich! Well, let's escape!

Yurii:
Sir Hero, please instruct the direction to escape!

Wendy:
We will leave the escape route to you. Please instruct us!

(if someone escapes west)

Yurii:
Everyone! We will escape toward Hingistan!

(after other party members escaped)

Yurii:
Everyone has gotten away. Let us go too!

Wendy:
Looks like it went well.
She is the one with the power to go through time?

Anita:
I am Anita.
I'm Brandole's daughter, younger sister of Shuweizer.

Wendy:
Huh, the Commander's!?
Then, we took you with us to fight your family?

Anita:
Yes. But this is what I wanted.
My father is not my father any more... He has changed into another person.

Yurii:
So you've noticed. The Infinitor has taken over the Commander's body.

Wendy:
Even so, putting his own daughter under experiments, and confined in the laboratory... How awful!

Yurii:
The Infinitor doesn't have feelings for family.

Rukias:
It's a bad place to get deep into conversation, but it would be trouble if those guys pursue us.
First let's hurry to a town. We can talk then.

(talk to soldier)

Fomeros Soldier:
Ahead of here is Hingistan Kingdom. If you're going to enter, show your proof of identity.

(select Monopolis ID)

Fomeros:
Please pass.

(reach Leystan area)

Yurii:
We are near the city.
Anita, are you all right?

Anita:
Yes, I am just tired.
I've been in that room for a long time, and this is the first time I've walked this much.

Wendy:
Let's go to a calm place to talk more.

(rest at inn)

Anita:
Let me introduce myself again. My name is Anita. I'm Brandole's daughter.
My father used a theory to travel through time, and had that experiment performed on me to give me that ability.
And then when the experiment was completed it was performed on my brother.

Rukias:
Then Shuweizer's is complete.

Anita:
Yes. I can travel through time by myself, but each time I require medicine.
However my brother doesn't need it. He can go with his own power.
And so using those results as a base, you two also had an operation...

Wendy:
Then, what kind of operation did Merklich and I have?

Anita:
Even if you travel through time by yourself, it is very difficult to change history.
So, they researched using Merklich to get the ability to bring attendants with the person traveling through time.
Under that technology, they developed a time resonance crystal. There is one implanted in Wendy.

Does Rukias have that crystal?

Rukias:
Is it this? A Monopolis soldier gave it to me when he died.

Wendy:
That crystal is inside me... That's how I can go to the past...

Anita:
I don't know how many times we can go to the past, but I should explain the dangers of traveling through time.

Wendy:
That's right. Please do.

Anita:
Traveling through time is not all-purpose. There are many limits with it.
First, you cannot go to the same time period twice.
It's from the scope of influence, so it can't be concretely said how long a period of time is.
However, if you couldn't change the past, then please give up.
This can be said to be the endurance of time itself.

Rukias:
It's a one-chance shot, huh...

1) We have been lucky up to now
2) That's why Shuweizer gave up (*)
3) Remain silent

Rukias:
I also wondered about that. Even if we obstructed him once, why didn't he do the same thing again.
Because you can't go there again, you can't do it even if you wanted.

Anita:
Next, how far you can travel into the past is limited by the day that person was born. It can be said that that is the limit of the person's existence.

Yurii:
That is the same as fairies. We can't know the things that happened before we were born.

Anita:
However there is an exceptional case where you can go to a time before you were born.

Yurii:
How do you do that?

Anita:
Among the people going together, it's the day that the oldest person was born. That is the limit.
So for a person who is 20 years old, if he goes with a person who is 40 years old, then they can go back to time up to 40 years ago.

Wendy:
If we can ask Hofman, then we can go up to 30 years in the past, right?

Anita:
Finally this is the most important, absolutely do not come close to yourself in the past.
If you meet your own self in the past...

Yurii:
...Ah, that is dangerous...

Wendy:
If you meet, what will happen?

Yurii:
For example, let's say Wendy went to one year ago. In that time period, the current Wendy is not supposed to exist.
Simply saying, in that period of one year ago, the you of one year ago is the real thing. The you who came from the future becomes a fake.
The fake cannot win against the real one. Time will protect the existence of the real one, and erase the fake one.

Wendy:
Then the one that came from the future will die?

Anita:
It's not a death of a living creature. It's the death of existence.
Traveling to the past is to deceive time, and you will remain in the past.
If there is a same identity in the same place and time notices it, time will correct the mistake and merge the two selves into one.
As a result, the fake one is absorbed into the real one and becomes one person.
And then the first rule of caution is applied.

Rukias:
The first... about going to the past only one time?

Anita:
Yes. As result of the fusion with the past self, that person will forever lose the ability to travel through time.
In other words, you will come to live in the past's existence inside the past self.

Rukias:
You'll be left behind in the past?
It's quite dangerous to spontaneously go to the past.

Anita:
Yes. Well, what kind of situation are we going to use my power?

Wendy:
My brother Maxwell, the Resistance leader, committed suicide in Yarstill prison...
The Resistance lost their leader, and without control, turned into mere terrorists. Therefore...

Anita:
I see, it's to save that person.
Understood. Please take me to that place.

Yurii:
But is it really all right? Traveling through time will take a toll on your body...
Moreover it will become disadvantageous to Monopolis.

Anita:
My father has changed. It seems like he's turned into my grandfather.
This time please let me ask a question. As you know my father has changed.
If you know why, please tell me.

1) Tell her about the Infinitor (*)
2) Leave to the others to explan to her
3) Remain silent

Anita:
......
...Is that so? The invader Infinitor's...
Then now I know everything.
It could be that I have the power to travel through time, sometimes I can see the future.
In the future my father is erased from this world.
Perhaps if history keeps going as it is, it will become that way. I can't allow that at all.
You are the ones who can make that future uncertain.
You are perhaps the ones that can erase the future that is destructive. That is the reason I will lend you my power.
If it's for that sake I'm ready to give my life.

Wendy:
Anita... thank you very much.
But, we're not going to let you die. Please believe us!

Anita:
Yes, I will leave it to you.

Rukias:
So then, first we go to Yarstill to save Maxwell.

Innkeeper:
Ah, good customers, you are just in time!
A while ago, a messenger came saying he'll wait before the headquarters.

Wendy:
The headquarters, you mean Monopolis? But who is it?

Innkeeper:
Well.... if I said chocolate person would you know?

(leave inn)

Innkeeper:
Ah, that reminds me, good customers!
I heard the shops have stocked new goods. How about you have a look?

(exit city, use Transgate to Makinus)

Yurii:
So someone is waiting in front of the headquarters.

Wendy:
It's dangerous but we have to go. If we're found out by Monopolis then it will be the end. Let's go carefully.

(go to headquarters entrance and talk to the "woman")

Woman:
...Oh, what nice weather...

Yurii:
Huh?

Disguise King:
(You didn't notice? It's me.)

Wendy:
I didn't think you'd change into a lady.

Disguise King:
(The Shrine Maiden is inside now. I am keeping watch, so you all fulfill your objective.)

Wendy:
...Even so, how can we get to the prison...

Disguise King:
(I don't know your reason, but you want to go to the prison?
If so then a ship transporting materials periodically from there comes here.)

Wendy:
A ship? Thank you...

Disguise King:
...It's really great weather!

Wendy:
The ship must be that...

(walk there)

Wendy:
That ship must transport cargo to the prison.

Rukias:
If we sneak into the ship, won't we be found when we enter the prison?

Wendy:
Hmm, it doesn't seem like we can get in with normal disguises.

Rukias:
Yeah. Even if we can get to the prison, if we're not normal things then a disguise would be meaningless.

Wendy:
Hmm... how about disguise as prisoners...?

Rukias:
We'd be able to get inside, but we'll be put in prisons and can't get out.

(check the crates)

[Contents: Miscellaneous goods
Destination: Yarstill prison]

Wendy:
Ah, that's it! Let's hide in these wooden boxes!

[Will you hide in boxes?]
1) Do it later
2) Get in now (*)

Anita:
Uffh...
...Hehe, being like this is kind of fun.

Yurii:
Anita! Why are you in here?

Anita:
If we use lots of boxes to hide in, it will be easier for us to get found.
...Well that's the logical reason, but it's just that I want to be with you.

Yurii:
...It seems I will have to review my impression of you...
I didn't think you'd be this daring.
It seems I still don't understand a lot about humans.

1) Anita has always been very bold
2) Agree with Yurii (*)
3) Remain silent

Anita:
That's not it. Even so I had to muster a little courage...

Yurii:
Why is that?

Anita:
It's... I want him to have his memories back.
At least remember just those ten days I was with him.
I really want all of his memories to return...

Yurii:
Exactly what happened in those ten days? ...Ah, I'm not saying to force you to talk, but...

Anita:
I don't mind. It's me who wants the memories to return.
But, in actuality there wasn't really anything.
From the day my father changed, I was forced to live just for experiments.
I thought many times of wanting to die, but I wasn't let to die.
A few years passed and the experiment succeeded for once, and I obtained the ability to return to the past.
And then that time, my father took you in.

Yurii:
Your father is Commander Brandole, right? The commander brought Sir Hero?

Anita:
I wasn't told of any details, but I was ordered to care for you.
The reason was that the ability to pass through time was also affixed to you.

Yurii:
Is that what happened...

Anita:
At that time I didn't even have hope to live. Even if I remember it now I was a horrible, dark woman.
The one who listened to my pain and gave me hope to live was you.
I was only with you for ten days. But in that ten days I was born anew.
Therefore I wanted you to also remember that day.

Yurii:
For a person's life to change in ten days, Sir Hero is an incredible person.

Anita:
I didn't have a purpose to live for anyone else.
Even among that the thing that stays in my mind is that painful expression every time you showed the wound on your chest.
That is not only the wound's pain, it's the mental pain of the time you suffered that wound.
I had you listen to me and I was saved. Therefore next time I wanted to save you.
But you had the operation and lost all the memories of before...

Yurii:
So you want to return a favor.

Anita:
Return a favor? It's not such a good thing as that.
My feeling now is my ego.

Yurii:
Ego?

Anita:
Frankly speaking, I like you. In that ten days I fell in love.
I want you to have interest in me. So I want you to remember those ten days. That's the ego.

Yurii:
Anita...

Anita:
Although it was just ten days of chance, I must be strange to fuss over it so much.

Yurii:
Anita, those ten days were not just chance.
Things that happen in the future are not certain. But if you hope with strong thoughts, that future will come.
With such a meaning the future is inevitable.

Anita:
It sounds difficult.

Yurii:
Please think about it simply. If you hope strongly, and you act according to it that future will come.
Those ten days that happened because you yourself wanted to change.

Anita:
The future that I hope for will come. That gives me courage somehow.

1) That's why we should act toward it (*)
2) It won't go that well
3) Remain silent

Yurii:
That is right. If you don't give up until the end, then certainly the path will open up.

Anita:
...Haha, talking about all of this has made me feel refreshed.
Although I just confessed, there is no need for immediate reply.
No matter if I am either refused or accepted, I'll become unable to concentrate on the plan. And then we'll be in trouble.
However, when everything is over, please remember what I said today.
...I'm really embarrassed. Let's end our conversation today... From now concentrate on the strategy.

Crew Member:
...Oof! This is all of the cargo...

Guard:
Okay, received.

Crew Member:
How shall we carry it?

Guard:
As usual, make the prisoners do it.

Crew Member:
Understood. Then, see you in one week!

Guard:
Thanks.

Wendy:
Ugh, that was uncomfortable...

Yurii:
We've arrived safely.

Rukias:
If we don't hurry, the guard will return.

Anita:
Then, we will move to the past now.
Then, let's go...

+Past Yastill Prison+

Anita:
...Ugh...

Yurii:
Hang on! Are you all right?

Anita:
...I'm all right. More importantly, let's hurry... We don't have time.

Rukias:
This is the past?

Anita:
Yes. We have gone ten days back.

Yurii:
......
Maxwell is not dead.
It's all right. We can save him now.

Wendy:
...Please wait, brother...

(enter prison)

Wendy:
Where could my brother be...

Rukias:
The surroundings must be full of guards. Let's proceed carefully.

(talk to prisoner in nearest cell)

Wendy:
Where is Maxwell?

Resistance Member:
In a special cell inside. I'm counting on you.

(go north)

Anita:
Here must be the special cells.

Wendy:
My brother is here...

Yurii:
First let us confirm Maxwell's cell.

(talk to Maxwell in lower right)

Maxwell:
Hm? You guys!

Wendy:
Brother! Are you all right?

Maxwell:
Why are you here?

Wendy:
You were taken hostage, and Iris had to obey Monopolis.

Maxwell:
...I see. Because of me, she had to...

Wendy:
We're going to rescue you now.

Maxwell:
I'm sorry.

(talk again)

Maxwell:
Oh, wait a bit!

Yurii:
What is the matter?

Maxwell:
If we're going to leave here, we will probably have to fight the guards. So before that I want you to bring me my weapon.

Yurii:
Where is it?

Maxwell:
In the lower floor there is a door with a number lock. Press 4-2-3-1-5 in order and the lock should open.

Yurii:
4-2-3-1-5?

(go back south and go to lower right room door)

[There is a door with combination lock with digits 1 to 5.]
1) Try to release it (*)
2) Do nothing

(punch in the combination, get treasure chest)

+Obtained Maxwell's Spear!+

(go back to Maxwell)

+Passed Maxwell's Spear!+

Maxwell:
Thank you!

(look around a bit)

Prisoner:
Hey, you guys! You seem different from the prison people! Please get me out of here!

Yurii:
We are very sorry, but we do not have time.

Prisoner:
No, don't say that! Well, I'll tell you something good!
Inside there on the floor there are nine blocks lined up. When you step on it, the block will light and unlight.
The block you step on will also make the rank and file blocks react. And so, the lighted block will be the key to the corresponding cells.
When the center-most is lighted and you move the right switch, then you'll open the cell that I'm in. It's simple.
When two people step on a block then all the blocks will unlight, so beware.
Finally, I am in this cell separate from the bad prisoners. Don't open their cells carelessly.
Well, I gave you helpful information! Please, get me out of here!

Guard:
Who the hell are you!

Yurii:
We have been discovered! Everyone, let's hurry!

(defeat all enemies)

Yurii:
Let's open Maxwell's cell quickly!

(make party members defend, and Merklich step on the floor lights. open Maxwell's cell, and Resistance members and the prisoner who talked to you)

Maxwell:
Oh, you opened it!

Yurii:
Maxwell's cell has opened!
Now, we must escape together!
Hurry and escape!

(kill all enemies. the enemies drop blue, red, and green keys. use them on the correponding doors. exit south)

Maxwell:
Thank you, Please take this.

+Obtained Land's Pendant!+

Maxwell:
If you show this to Iristelessa, she will know that I am safe.

Wendy:
Where are you going?

Maxwell:
I have to go somewhere to make a new base of operations.
First I will contact my comrades in each land. I will also send word to you after.

Anita:
Then, we will return to the present time.

+Present+

Anita:
...Ugh... haa, haa...

Yurii:
Anita, are you all right?

Anita:
I'm all right...Let's get out of this place.

(go northeast and activate Transgate. go back to Makinus, talk to Disguise King in front of Monopolis)

Disguise King:
Ah, hello. Today is beautiful too!
(You all returned safely I see. The Shrine Maiden is in the building now.)

Anita:
Let's go. With my access rights we can go to the top floor.

Disguise King:
(Do be careful.)

(enter Monopolis headquarters)

Wendy:
We can't let ourselves be captured after coming this far, so let's go carefully.

[[Clear Conditions
- All enemies defeated

Game Over Conditions

(attempt to use elevator with ID and Card Key)

[This card key has become suspended. Please enter a correct card in the scanner.]

Wendy:
It's no good after all.

Anita:
Then I will release it.

[Special being frequency detected. Access to topmost floor permitted.]

Anita:
Ugh...

Rukias:
Hey, are you all right?

Anita:
I have to rest a little... Take care of the Shrine Maiden first...
I will wait here.

(talk to Iristelessa)

Iristelessa:
You people...

Wendy:
We rescued my brother... Maxwell. You don't have to do as Shuweizer says any more.

Iristelessa:
Is that true?

Wendy:
Yes, we have proof.

(select Land's Pendant, 大地のペンダント)

Wendy:
This is the proof. He said if we show you this, you will know.

Iristelessa:
This is something I gave him...
I see... Maxwell is saved...

Wendy:
Therefore now you don't have to cooperate with Shuweizer!

Iristelessa:
It's certainly good that I'm not Shuweizer's pawn any more.
However I will remain here after all.

Wendy:
Why?

Iristelessa:
Shuweizer's actions and my objecive is about the same.
To defeat the Infinitor in the commander.
The future Shuweizer experienced it, and had me tell it to the present Shuweizer.

1) We should work together if our goal is the same (*)
2) Don't depend on him
3) Point out the possibility of him becoming the next Infinitor

Wendy:
Yes! That's right!
Or is there a reason we can't fight together?

Iristelessa:
It's...
When I see Merklich it's painful. He has the same face as that person...
My Brave Guard sacrificed his life to protect me.
If you too were to die because of me...
If that happens again... I won't... be able to bear it...

1) I'm not going to die (*)
2) For the sake of the world, you should endure
3) And you call yourself the Shrine Maiden!?

Iristelessa:
...You're lying!

Yurii:
Please stop threatening about things in the future that have not come.

Iristelessa:
What?

Yurii:
Sir Hero is reliable. Because of that you are all here, right?!

Iristelessa:
......
...Understood.
Then we will also tell Shuweizer the situation and ask for cooperation.

[Iristelessa has become an ally!]

Wendy:
(Hey, Yurii. Is it the truth that he is reliable? Do you know the future with your fairy power?)

Yurii:
(A lie is also a means. For now the future is a blur so we cannot foretell.)

Wendy:
What...

Yurii:
But, there is a basis. The wills that we want to fulfill will decide the future that triumphs.

Anita:
Oh... brother...

Shuweizer:
It can't be that you have betrayed us too...
I never could have imagined this.

Anita:
Please stop it, brother! Now we should help each other.
You can also see it, right? That thing that has possessed father is going to ruin our world and future!

Shuweizer:
It's precisely because I know that that I am acting this way.
I'll prevent the destruction, and it will be me to control the world!

Wendy:
If that's so you'll have to defeat us! If you can do so, we will cooperate with you!

Shuweizer:
...How interesting!

Anita:
No, stop it... I don't want us to fight...

Shuweizer:
You stay out of it. You'll get hurt!

======================================

Shuweizer:
Drop dead!

(Shuweizer defeated)

Shuweizer:
What!? No, I am...

Yurii:
The match is decided.

(after battle)

Shuweizer:
Damn it... even I...

Anita:
Brother, it's a promise. Please cooperate with them.

Shuweizer:
......

Anita:
Brother!

Shuweizer:
...Ugh, fine. I will keep the promise.

Anita:
Brother...

Shuweizer:
Then, what will we do?

Rukias:
For the time being, we should obstruct the previous Commander's actions.
After that, kill the transferred soul... or seal it...

Shuweizer:
My old man built something called Dragon Abyss Towers in the world. There are four locations in all.
His own direct troops defend them so it's quite fortified.
But the most bothersome is the way to destroy these Towers.

Wendy:
That reminds me, you were going to use the giant before to destroy something.

Iristelessa:
From the investigation afterwards, it was understood that the giant wasn't used after all.

Rukias:
What does that mean? Is it that sturdy?

Iristelessa:
The Dragon Abyss Tower is built above a spot where the Dragon Vein energy running in the earth gathers. Its objective is to extract the earth's energy.
In those pits, unimaginable amounts of power are concentrated, and by controlling at four locations it maintains balance.

Yurii:
Maintains the balance...

Shuweizer:
Yes, balance. Therefore, even if you stop one of the locations, the Dragon Vein will run wildly, and this planet will be destroyed.
To stop the Dragon Abyss Towers, all four locations must be done at the same time.
The postponed feedback of the wild energy running to the other towers is estimated to be three hours at longest...
In other words, after stopping the first tower, the others must be stopped within three hours.

1) Can't we take over the control of the towers? (*)
2) What was your reason for using the giant?
3) Consent

Iristelessa:
We already tried doing that by using the Dragon Orb's power, but it was unsuccessful.
Apparently the part that controls the Dragon Abyss Tower is completely blocked. It will not receive operation from outside.

Anita:
Then now is when we need to cooperate the most.

Shuweizer:
It is mortifying, but you guys have strength. I'll accept your cooperation.

Yurii:
We did it, Sir Hero. We've made another step forward to save the world.

(talk to Shuweizer)

Shuweizer:
...Be at ease, I will keep the promise. Let me rest now.
Indeed, you've really done it...
Nevertheless, I never thought you'd take Anita out from the prison.
Well, certainly she seems to like you. If she is asked by you, she would gladly cooperate.
However you, because of the operation, have completely forgotten of her, right?
Indeed, that girl is pitiable...
I want you to promise me this. Anita's body is weak. Do not make her bear too much.

(talk to characters)

Anita:
If you and my brother join hands, there's nothing to fear!
I like you but I also like my brother, and I'll believe in it.
For the sake of you two, I will do my best!

Wendy:
It feels like one burden is lifted from our shoulders.
But we can't say the war in Hingistan is settled.

Iristelessa:
It must be that I am the great land Shrine Maiden that I strained too much for myself.
However, from now I will look at the surroundings.
My ancestors didn't succeed at making the seal alone.

Rukias:
It feels like we've made a step forward to our objective.
I regret it but I also feel like you could proceed without me.
I'll have to be more helpful so that I don't get left behind.

(walk away)

Shuweizer:
What is this!?
You are, Neilis?

Neilis:
Orders... Remove Shuweizer...

Shuweizer:
...Ugh!

Anita:
Brother!

Shuweizer:
...Why...

Neilis:
Those who can freely travel through time will be a disturbance to Infinitor's plans...
Next is you... I will definitely kill you!

Shuweizer:
...I... came this far...

Yurii:
No... at long last...

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Yurii:
Yes, come in.
Iris...
What's the matter?

Iristelessa:
Never... I never imagined Shuweizer would be killed.
Certainly I have thought that Infinitor was aiming after his body.
But, to think he would kill him...

1) The spare body is no longer needed
2) It's a big risk to leave him alive (*)
3) The Infinitor can proceed in his plans

Yurii:
Someone who has the power to travel through time could certainly become an obstacle to plans.
By the way, Iris. I want to ask about the story of the Brave Guard who died protecting you...

1) Wait for the conversation to progress
2) I want to hear it (*)

Iristelessa:
...I see. It can't be said that he has no relation to it...
It was three years ago.
Maxwell and I escaped from the village being attacked by Monopolis, but we were captured at last.
At that time we could only give up, and there was no way, but the Brave Guard appeared singlehandedly to help us.
However...

Brave Guard:
Ugh!

Iristelessa:
What's wrong, hang in there! We're almost out of here!

Brave Guard:
It seems I have failed...

Iristelessa:
That injury on your chest... it's dreadful...

Maxwell:
A broken blade has pierced your chest!

Iristelessa:
Wait, I will pull it out!

Maxwell:
Stop! If you take it out, his blood will spurt and and he'll soon bleed to death!

Iristelessa:
Then what should we do!?

Maxwell:
...Unh...

Brave Guard:
...I will stop them here. You two escape from the river.

Iristelessa:
But, with such an injury...!

Brave Guard:
Yes, I can't keep them long... That's why, please hurry and go...

Iristelessa:
I cannot leave you!

Brave Guard:
You have a mission you have to fulfill! You cannot die here!
...Please take care of Iris...

Maxwell:
...Understood...

Iristelessa:
No! I cannot go!

Maxwell:
Are you going to make his actions in vain, he who would give his life to save you!?

Iristelessa:
......

Brave Guard:
Now, go!
...Goodbye... Iris...

Iristelessa:
From the river, I saw him fall in the middle of battle...
And that was the last time I saw him. Perhaps, after that...

Yurii:
I see...

Iristelessa:
When I look at your face, I remember that person with pain.
Therefore I was going to go with Shuweizer to fight the Infinitor.
...But, I can't run any more...
As a great land Shrine Maiden, I will absolutely defeat Infinitor.
So, please lend me your hand. I cannot flee any more.

Commander 13:
Their numbers are too different...
I'm sorry, I made light of the great land Shrine Maiden's power, it is my mistake.

Neilis:
No. Even I cannot have imagined that much power.
It is not your fault.

Commander 13:
However, the responsibility of the troops being decreased this much is mine.
Neilis, I have a request.

Neilis:
What is it?

Commander 13
Take the remaining soldiers back.

Neilis:
You, are you willing to die!?

Commander 13:
I have no intention of dying.
However, someone has to remain to drive off the pursuers.
After I confirm that you all have escaped, I will also escape.

Neilis:
...Really...?

Commander 13:
As a soldier of Infinitor, I will carry out the mission to the end.

Neilis:
...Understood...
But you will be alone. You have to make it back alive!
Hey, you! We will back him together!

Commander 13:
...Then, for my allies, I will fight again!

[Three days after Shuweizer was killed]

Yurii:
Good morning. Everyone is already waiting at the hall.

(exit room)

Wendy:
Good morning, Merklich. Rukias has returned with Hofman.

Iristelessa:
Anita wants to talk about the matters from here, so she said she wants us to come to the 10th floor's office room.

(go to 10F Monopolis building and to the room)

Shayer:
Enter.

Wendy:
We kept you waiting.

Shayer:
All the members are here now.
Then, new commander, if you please.

Anita:
Then, we will discuss the matters from here. We'll have to somehow destroy the Dragon Abyss Towers, and stop my father... the invader's ambitions...

Shayer:
Before that, there are important points to say first.
The previous Commander's body was stolen by Infinitor. That fact is only known to the smallest number of people outside of us.
Monopolis is a corporation, so we must absolutely avoid the corporation's image being lowered.
For the sake of the employees' lifestyles, please work thoroughly as a group.

Maxwell:
We will still be acting as Monopolis employees. We will keep that in mind.

Hofman:
Even if one person in management does something independently, people view it as the whole corporation.
It's not limited to corporations, it's the same for countries. If you cause an incident outside your country, your country will be viewed as bad. That is ordinary.

Shayer:
It is good to have people understand. Then, Miss Anita, please continue.

Anita:
Yes.
There are four Dragon Abyss Towers in all. One is in Fomeros, two are in Hingistan, and the last one is in the neighboring continent which was sealed.

Iristelessa:
All must be destroyed within three hours. Moreover, if we do not act as quickly as we can, then the Infinitor will succeed in his plan.

Anita:
For that, we will have to settle the war and be able to attain cooperation from all countries.

Hofman:
...May I say something?
I am a soldier of Fomeros army. However currently I'm a fugitive.
You may know, but Fomeros will soon have an election to decide the next president.
The current president Glyme is aiming after Hingistan's resources, and is pro-war.
And the rival candidate is Dietrich, who is anti-war.
In Fomeros, the opinion that war should be stopped has become great. The current president Glyme's faction is getting impatient.

Shayer:
We know that even if you didn't say so. Furthermore there is rumor that both are involved in scandals.
There was a scandal in Dietrich's circle, But the proof that Glyme faction presented is suspicious.
Moreover it seems there are many rumors flying about, such as Glyme himself making the army his own.

Hofman:
Haha, you know that much, huh? That's quite good.

Shayer:
So then, how does it relate to you?

Hofman:
Putting it clearly, the relative of Dietrich who is target of the scandal is me. Dietrich is my older brother.

Wendy:
What! Then Hofman is the one in that incident...?

Hofman:
The scandal is that I diverted materials into illegal channels. And proof of that is the document that indicates that I did it.
The handwriting on that document is different from mine, but it was accepted as credible proof.

Shayer:
...Apparently it's the truth. The information here is completely the same.

Hofman:
I always insisted that Fomeros army should not intervene with Hingistan citizens' independence.
Of course, my brother is running for election with the same ideal.
However Wellber, who set me into a trap, has particularly strong ties with the current president Glyme.
That reminds me, it was mentioned before? Glyme has made the army into his own thing.
With the facts as they are, I could not be arrested quietly.
I wouldn't be able to prove my innocence in front of the military conference.

Rukias:
In other words, you cannot be captured until you obtain proof of your innocence...

Hofman:
That is correct. If I find proof and return to the army, it's white. If I am arrested before I find it, it's black. Now both things are gray, and the electorate is in puzzlement.
However speaking conversely, for me to become "white" then the scandalous proof that Glyme faction presented becomes "black". The electorate will be in favor of my brother.

Shayer:
I see. The key to this election is you.

Hofman:
If my brother is elected as the new president, then he would absolutely not advance war. He would have careful supervision, and if it goes well, make the soldiers recede.
I believe I could negotiate that with my brother.

Maxwell:
If Fomeros army doesn't act in Hingistan Kingdom any more, then the remaining problem is just to take care of Hingistan domestically.

Hofman:
But isn't that the biggest problem?
In the first place, the reason that Fomeros dispatched soldiers was to fight the regular army fighting to subjugate the liberation army which fights for Hingistan citizens' independence, and the liberation army transfigured into terrorist movements?
Say that Fomeros army withdrew. then Hingistan's internal conflict will still last a considerable amount of time.

Wendy:
Then I have an idea. Okay, brother?

Maxwell:
Yes.
Half a year ago, Hingistan's first prince Gilliam died in battle, and I believe everyone here knows that.

Hofman:
Yes. After that the war with Fomeros became intensified.
Moreover with the second prince gone missing, the prime minister has taken authority.

Maxwell:
So you know that much?
Well, that second prince who went missing is none other than me.

Hofman:
What?

Shayer:
Then, you are...

Maxwell:
The royal family and its retainers are the only ones in the country who live in wealth, by exploiting the lives of many citizens. My reason for leaving the castle was to change that.
That may have been good in the past.
However, the neighboring countries have democratized and are changing for the better, and if Hingistan remains unchanged from the old state of things then it will eventually crumble.
If it doesn't change now, Hingistan Kingdom will have no future.

Wendy:
Furthermore, the prime minister Zafreed has forced our sister to marry, and now he has taken firm authority.
It is already too late for our father the king even if he noticed that, therefore I left the castle to search for my brother.

Maxwell:
Indeed, if only our father listened to my words that time...
But there's no use lamenting about matters that have passed. Conversely we'll change the situation into our chance.

Iristelessa:
The prime minister who controls the country, and the royal family manipulated by that prime minister...
If we can defeat that, the revolution will be a success. The grounds can be accomplished.

Maxwell:
Yes.

Hofman:
But, if you, the second prince, carries that out, I think it won't become a revolution?

Maxwell:
Why do you think I have come this far without revealing my lineage?
I do not intend to reveal my identity until the end. I will destroy the current administration as a Hingistan citizen.

Anita:
...Understood.
The presidential election in Fomeros... the revolution of Hingistan Kingdom...
If we immediately succeed in those two, then we can make a world without war.
Monopolis will cooperate on full-scale.
Is that fine, Shayer?

Shayer:
It's probably good to make some publicity expenses. Most of all there is no one who will object the Commander's command.

Anita:
Then, which issue should we deal with...

Hofman:
If possible, I'd like to settle my problem. There is only half a month until the presidential election.

Anita:
Then we shall hurry for that.
...Merklich,
I will leave the details to you.

Wendy:
My brother and I will take charge of the Hingistan side.

Iristelessa:
Understood. End it as quickly as you can, and we will meet up with you.

Maxwell:
Until then, let us prepare thoroughly.

Shayer:
Then, please take Hofman's proof of identity at the reception on the first floor.
If you have that then you can pass the country borders without being suspected.

(talk to Anita)

Anita:
...I cannot help with anything now, but please do your best.
Even for my brother who is lost... please do...

(the database on 8F has been updated, if you read it...)

(go to 1F reception)

Receptionist:
Hofman's identity card? Right away.
Here it is.

Hofman:
Thank you.

Iristelessa:
Then, where shall we go?

Hofman:
I'd like to go to Royferon. What the supreme officer has is in that city. There must be a clue there.

Rukias:
To go there, it's certainly...

Hofman:
From Leystan, follow the road northwest. On the way we'll have to pass borders, but this ID will be immediately helpful.

(go near the armor shop and talk to Wendy)

Wendy:
Have you made preparations? We're going to take a bit longer.
...Say, I... thanks to Anita then we were able to save my brother Maxwell.
Can't we save Shuweizer as well?

1) It's impossible
2) It may be possible (*)

Wendy:
Yeah!

Yurii:
Wendy.
We were there at that time. If we meet our past selves before we can do something...

Wendy:
...Oh, that's right. So that's why Anita didn't say anything.

Yurii:
Perhaps...

Wendy:
Anita is strong.
Even though she is supposed to be suffering, she doesn't show it.
Above that, she's working hard as the commander.

1) Wendy has also been calm (*)
2) Wendy is weak

Wendy:
...It's because I knew that Maxwell could be saved. I was only acting calm.
But comparing to Anita, she really has strength.
You've given me confidence. Thank you, Merklich.

(exit Makinus, use Transgate to Leystan, talk to woman in front of inn)

Woman:
You, do you know my daughter? She's still not returned...
Oh Lera... come home soon...

Rukias:
......

Yurii:
Is something the matter, Rukias?

Rukias:
...That person is Lera's mother...

Yurii:
Does she know?

Rukias:
...She's a good person... but doesn't accept that her daughter is dead, and now she is this way...
Let's go. It's painful to look at her...

(go to item shop and buy 5 Restorative medicine, 「気付け薬」
exit Leystan and go north)

Man:
Eek, eee!
Ack, here too!
It's useless!

Hofman:
What! What's that!?

Rukias:
(...Tch! Again... it's happening here again!
Damn it! That memory is still...!)

Hofman:
A citizen!? It's dangerous there!

1) Save him immediately (*)
2) Leave it to everyone else
3) What a bother...

Rukias:
Of course.

======================================
MISSION BATTLE 33 Fomeros Merchant
[[Clear Conditions:
- All monsters defeated

Game Over Condiitons
- Death of merchant
- All party members defeated]]
--------------------------------------
Complete: Merchant was attacked 2 or less times
Clear: Merchant was attacked 3-5 times
Failed: Merchant was attacked 6 or more times
======================================

(after battle)

Merchant:
Thank you for saving me! I will not forget this favor.
I run an item shop in Royferon. But goods are insufficient in Fomeros, so I came to Leystan to procure them.
If possible, please let me repay the favor, so please visit me when I'm in Royferon.

(go west 3 maps, talk to soldier on bridge)

Fomeros Soldier:
From here is Fomeros country.
Show your ID in order to enter.

(select Monopolis ID)

Fomeros Soldier:
Please pass.

(go west, activate Transgate, enter Royferon)

Hofman:
This is Royferon. I'm not very familiar with it though.
Wellber came here for some reason. There must be something here...

(talk to man near inn)

Man:
Do you guys know about the black market meeting place?

Hofman:
Black market? No, we don't.

Man:
They know that we need goods for our lifestyles, so they raise the prices.
Moreover, the black market isn't that big so it's seldom talked about.
So, you guys don't even know of it...

Hofman:
Who did you hear about the black market from?

Man:
I just heard it from hearsay, but a shopkeeper somewhere said that we can't sell goods because of the black market...

(enter big blue door building, talk with merchant in right)

Owner:
Welcome! Please feel free to look!

Iristelessa:
Jewels, I see.

Rukias:
They're selling jewels in such times?

Hofman:
Near the vicinity of the battlefront, they often use jewels to exchange for assets...
This is in the country's borders but it's far from battlefield so there is no demand. Especially in these times...

Owner:
That's so, recently we can't sell... Be it this or that, it's decided because of the black market.

Rukias:
(Those articles don't have anything to do with the black market...)

Hofman:
Umm, where are they having the black market?

Owner:
No way. You're going to there when I tell it to you, right? I can't tell you if it means my loss.

Hofman:
Then I will pay for information.

Owner:
I have thought of that, but... goods are better than money.
My mother is getting old in age. Won't you give me five restorative medicines?

[Will you hand over 5 Restorative Medicines?]
1) Yes (*)
2) No

Owner:
Oho, thank you. Now we will be fine even if mother faints.

Hofman:
Tell us the location of the black market.

Owner:
The black market is the storehouse behind the base. If you tell the password to the gravekeeper he will let you pass.
The password is: "I want to die in the graveyard rather than battlefield".

(exit building, go west of city, talk to man in front of door)

Gravekeeper:
What are outsiders like you coming to this graveyard for?

Merklich:
1) Say the password (*)
2) Leave

Merklich:
1) I want to live in the battliefield rather than protect the graveyard
2) I want to die in the battlefield rather than die in the graveyard
3) I want to die in the graveyard rather than the battlefield (*)
4) I want to live as a gravekeeper rather than die on the battlefield

Gravekeeper:
What is this, guests?

(enter building)

Rukias:
It seems like a very busy place.

Hofman:
I heard that the number of articles is few, but this is not an ordinary market.
Just how do they distribute? It's too strange...

Iristelessa:
Let us investigate.

(talk to person at counter in top left)

Hofman:
There are various things, but only Fomeros official goods.
That reminds me, do you have durandal?

Merchant:
Wait a bit. I will look in the stock.

Hofman:
...Hm? ...Those wooden boxes...

Rukias:
Is something the matter?

Hofman:
Um, ah, a little...

Merchant:
Sorry but we're out. Wait until the next shipment.

Hofman:
I see, too bad.
Can I have a moment?

(talk to Hofman)

Yurii:
What's the matter, Hofman?

Hofman:
That storeperson went to check the stock, right? That time, that man investigated that crates... Those are probably the army's materials.

Iristelessa:
Is that true?

Hofman:
I want to confirm that.
Divide into two groups, one will act as lookout, the other will confirm the goods.

Iristelessa:
It would be better for Hofman to go check the goods, right?
We will be here, so please do so.

Hofman:
All right, let's immediately do the operation.

+Investigate the goods without being noticed!+

[Do you need explanation of the rules?]
1) Yes (*)
2) No

[Two allies will pull the attention of the storekeeper and bodyguard. You must examine the contents of the crates without being noticed by the patrolling guards. After examining, return to this spot.]

(walk inside storage place and check boxes)

Hofman:
There should be codes written in alphabet and numbers displaying the destination of the cargo.
Look at those thoroughly.

[Which box will you examine?]
1) Left top
2) Right top
3) Left bottom
4) Right bottom

(examine all)

Hofman:
How did it go?

1) There is no rule
2) There is a rule (*)
3) I didn't understand well

Hofman:
What kind of rule?

1) It begins with AH32 (*)
2) It begins with AM32
3) It begins with AW32

Hofman:
I knew it was so...
Well let's return to everyone else.

(go to party when safe)

Hofman:
Talking here would be bad. Let's go to the inn.

(go back to Royferon inn to rest)

Yurii:
Then, Hofman, will you tell us the details?

Hofman
I've confirmed that Wellber participated in that black market.

Rukias:
And the evidence?

Hofman:
On all of those boxes the code written on them begins with AH32.

Yurii:
What does that mean?

Hofman:
AH32 is Captain Wellber's code, the one who trapped me. In other words, that cargo was sent from his unit.

Iristelessa:
That Wellber person's post is not in Royferon, right?

Hofman:
Right. In the 32nd supply unit, it was my duty to send materials to the frontlines.
In other words the cargo labeled AH32 was diverted during transport.

Iristelessa:
The fact that the cargo is not at the base but in this city means that...

Hofman:
Indeed, it can only be diverted into illegal channels.

Yurii:
I want to ask just to make sure, but that is also an improper thing among human society, right?

Hofman:
Speaking of enterprises, misappropriation and embezzlement are not permitted.
I've made a brief memo of the cargo's numbers. I can probably use it as some kind of evidence.

+Obtained Cargo Number Memo!+

Hofman:
But just this is still not enough proof.

Rukias:
Hey, how were you put into a trap?

Hofman:
Hm... that's...

Wellber:
Hofman! Where is B Group's captain Hofman!

Hofman:
Did you call me, Captain Wellber!

Wellber:
I have to talk with you about the materials arrived today.

Hofman:
Yes, what is the matter?

Wellber:
As I can see, the materials received today are short two parts than arranged,

Hofman:
Yes, that is so. I have received report that the remaining goods will be delayed.

Wellber:
Just now, we're being attacked by Hingistan army, and the supply unit is at a standstill.
As it is it will be difficult to send materials to the frontlines.

Hofman:
Then, immediately send the relief unit!

Wellber:
I know that even if you didn't say so.
I will organize the relief unit and back the supply unit.
During that time, I will entrust you to defend this place.

Hofman:
Yes, understood! I will defend this place to the last!

Wellber:
Although, I don't think that enemies will pass the frontline and reach here.
At any rate, I'll leave it to you!

Fomeros Soldier:
That's quite unusual for the captain himself to go out. Usually it's only ordered subordinates.

Hofman:
That's so.
At any rate, let us not be off guard of vigilance.
It wouldn't be difficult for them to attack us with our small numbers.

Fomeros Soldier:
Yes sir!

Fomeros Soldier:
Sir Wellber, will it be okay with only them?
If Hofman dies...

Wellber:
It will be fine. As you can see he is quite capable.

Fomeros:
Argh! We're under attack!

Hofman:
What!? In this place?
All members, engage!

Hingistan Soldier:
Search for it! It should be in a box!

Hofman:
They're aiming for something in the cargo here?

Hingistan Soldier:
AH32-0100, here it is!
What, it's not here!?
Damn it, that man lied...!
Then we'll kill everyone!

Wellber:
What happened here!?

Hofman:
Captain... Hingistan army attacked...
My subordinates fought desperately and all were killed...

Wellber:
Don't be ridiculous! Enemies would not come to such a place!

Hofman:
It is not a lie! There are dead bodies there, aren't there!?

Fomeros Soldier:
Sir Wellber! The enemy soldier held this letter!

Wellber:
What are the contents, read it to me!

Fomeros:
...This is...!
A secret message of Hofman passing materials!

Wellber:
What!? You are passing materials to Hingistan army!?

Hofman:
That's ridiculous! Why would I do that!?
First, I have protected the supplies here!

Wellber:
...What did you protect! They're empty!

Hofman:
...What...!?
...No... Where are the contents...?

Wellber:
Are they already passed to the Hingistans...?

Hofman:
That's wrong!

Wellber:
What is wrong! Aren't the supplies gone now?!
And because you were seen by allies, you killed them to seal their mouths!

Hofman:
No! Please listen to me!

Wellber:
Ah, is that so. I have to listen to a detailed story.
Hey! Arrest Hofman!

Hofman:
Wait! I am innocent!

Wellber:
We will have it at the hearing.

Hofman:
Grr!

Wellber:
Don't let him escape! Capture him!

Hofman:
If I am arrested I will be undeservedly declared guilty at the military conference. My brother aiming for presidential election will fail. Therefore I cannot let myself be arrested.

Yurii:
And so that unit captain put the crime of theft onto Hofman.

Hofman:
Yes. The goods of that time have arrived here.

Rukias:
The more I listen to it, that officer is the political fixer.
However having just the numbers of those crates is not enough proof. What will we do?

Hofman:
North of this city there is a base to send supplies to the frontline.
Materials are once collected in that base to send to either this city or to Hingistan frontlines.
There should be records of all of the passage of the supplies there. If we check and compare this memo to those records, we will know who ordered the supplies, who approved it, and the destination.

Iristelessa:
But that is a Fomeros army base, right? How do you intend to sneak into it?

Hofman:
Sneaking in would be quite impossible. We'll have to enter it face-on.

Rukias:
Face-on, that would be a suicide move, won't it?

Hofman:
The roughest way is the final measure.
If we bring a present, they'll let us pass with no objection.

Yurii:
A present...

1) The true criminal
2) The wanted man before us (*)
3) There is no such thing

Hofman:
Yes.
I am the wanted man, right? ...Of course, I'm innocent though.

Rukias:
...I see. But, if we enter that way, how will you escape?

Hofman:
Well, somehow or other.

Iristelessa:
You're so at ease...

Hofman:
At any rate, we'll begin actions tomorrow.

(go to city exit)

Merchant:
Ah, you folks! Thank you for that time I was in danger!

Yurii:
It looks like you didn't get attacked by monsters this time.

Merchant:
Actually, I was attacked again. By monsters called Screapers!

Rukias:
You made it quite safely for being attacked my Screapers.

Merchant:
Monopolis guards helped me.
They said it was Red Wolf unit, but wow, so strong!
Thanks to that I could return here like this. Now I'll finally open my store again!

Yurii:
Red Wolf unit... Who exactly could it be?
It can't be Wendy, she's not here, right?

1) Maxwell
2) Wendy
3) Someone else (*)
4) I don't have interest in this topic

Iristelessa:
Yes. There should be more Red Wolf members.

Hofman:
Well, let's confirm that later, now let's go to the Fomeros army base.

(exit city, go east, then top left, walk to gate)

Hofman:
Let us confirm the plan.
First, you guys will say that you captured me and demand a reward.
They can't give you one right away, so they will make you wait inside.
In that span of time we will secretly investigate.

Yurii:
To investigate, the numbers in that list should match up to the persons, right?

Hofman:
Yes.
Then, are you ready?

1) Yes (*)
2) No

Hofman:
Well then, shall we go?

(walk to gate)

Iristelessa:
Excuse us!

Fomeros Soldier:
What is it? This is a military facility so civilians cannot enter!

Iristelessa:
We have captured the fugitive man and taken him here.

Fomeros Soldier:
What?
...It's true. This is the 32nd supply unit captain Hofman...

Rukias:
Since we caught the fugitive, we'll get a reward, right?

Fomeros Soldier:
Hm... Yes. Then first go inside.

(follow everyone to top left room)

Fomeros Soldier:
Please wait here in the waiting room.

Yurii:
We've gone according to plan up to here.

Rukias:
Then, the plan has two stages. We're counting on you.

(go to top left room)

Yurii:
You should check the goods on the list, right?

(search top left shelf)

[Which file will you examine?]
1) File A (*)
2) File B
3) File C

[Which item will you examine?]
1) AF
2) AH (*)
3) AJ

Let's take this note.

+Obtained Supply Record!+

(check the door to top right room)

Hofman:
......

Fomeros Base Commander:
Hofman. I can't know if you stay quiet, right? Did you really do it?

Hofman:
......

Fomeros Base Commander:
I could not have imagined that you would do something like misappropriate the military supplies.

Hofman:
Commander, I was framed.

Fomeros Base Commander:
Framed? By whom?

Hofman:
Captain of the 32nd supply unit, Wellber...

Fomeros Base Commander:
What? You will suspect your superior officer?

Hofman:
There's no point for a person of another unit to make me fall, right? There is no chance for anyone to do that.
The one who can ensnare me, and also the one in the position who could make suitable conditions.

Fomeros Base Commander:
Even so... Do you have proof?

Yurii:
We have it here!

Fomeros Base Commander:
What, who are you?

Yurii:
We brought evidence to prove Hofman's innocence!

Fomeros Base Commander:
What?

+Passed Supply Record!+

Fomeros Base Commander:
This note has the supplies authorizers, right?

Yurii:
We are sorry for taking it arbitrarily.
Please check and compare the record contents with the supplies in that memo.

+Passed Cargo Number Memo!+

Hofman:
In this connection, that list is the supplies' codes on the goods misappropriated into Royferon black market.

Fomeros Base Commander:
All are goods ordered by the president. Furthermore the receipt person is... Captain Wellber. The location of delivery and location of his post are unrelated...

Iristelessa:
Won't this become proof of embezzlement?

Fomeros Base Commander:
If this memo is confirmed to be genuine then it will be enough proof.

Rukias:
Then you can search the Royferon black market. That big number of crates didn't just disappear.

Fomeros Base Commander:
Understood. Lead me there. I will confirm it myself.

[Fomeros Base Commander has become a traveler!]

(go to exit)

Fomeros Soldier:
Base Commander, where are you going?

Fomeros Base Commander:
There is something I need to confirm. I will go out for a while.

Fomeros Soldier:
Be careful!

(go to Royferon black market)

Gravekeeper:
Hey, you guys, what are you doing here... Huh, that face...!
Aagghh!

Hofman:
So he ran because he knows the commander, huh.
The evidence could be erased. Let us hurry.

(go to the boxes)

Fomeros Base Commander:
This... is certainly the cargo on the list...

Man:
Hey, what are you doing!

Fomeros Base Commander:
I am from Fomeros army! I am investigating the crime of misappropriation!

Man:
What!?
It wasn't me! I was only left in charge of this place...

Fomeros Base Commander:
Then who was the one who ordered you?

Man:
It's...

Wellber:
That criminal is the man next to you, isn't it?

Fomeros Base Commander:
You dare to come here so brazenly?! You conspired with the president, and the proof of misappropriating a large amount of supplies is all here!

Wellber:
Ho, all the proof... In other words, if that were to be lost...

Hofman:
What are you going to do?

Wellber:
I came here pursuing an escaped soldier who embezzled goods. But I will have to attack the criminal resisting arrest.
The base commander became an unfortunate casualty of that battle... How does that outline sound?

Hofman:
You bastard! How far are you going to be so despicable!

Wellber:
I'm going to seal your mouths. Kill everyone in this place!

Man:
What!? You told me differently!
...Hey! I'll testify as much as I can, so help us!

======================================
MISSION BATTLE 34 Wellber's Conspiracy

======================================

(Hofman attacks Wellber)

Hofman:
Wellber! You not only framed me, you dared to involve my group's soldiers!
How do you intend to apologize to those fallen men!?

Wellber:
Ha! If you ordered your subordinates more tactfully they probably would not have died!

Hofman:
You!

(after killing a lot of soldiers)

Wellber:
Damn it! You've gotten this far! There's no other way!

Fomeros Base Commander:
He intends to run? Don't let him escape!

[[Clear Conditions
-Defeat Wellber

Game Over Conditions
-Wellber escapes
-Death of Base Commander
-Death of civilians
-Party annihilated]]

(defeat Wellber)

Wellber:
D-damn it... the great me...

(after battle)

Hofman:
...It's over...

Fomeros Base Commander:
As an honored soldier of the Fomeros country I will indict Wellber for misappropriating goods for his own profit.
Of course, the current president Glyme will prepare to meet some sparks!

Wellber:
...Grr...

Man:
The president misappropriated supplies illegally?

Woman:
Then the money we paid here goes into the president's pocket?

Man:
Damn! Such a scoundrel is running the country?

Hofman:
Everyone of the electorate! Let us see the direction to a proper government! Who will let our lives be improved? Your voices will be reflected in the election!
I cannot tell you who to vote for. I only ask you to think well when voting!

Man:
That's right! At least withdraw the scoundrel who will continue the war until it troubles the citizens!

Woman:
Yes, right! I will tell everyone!

Iristelessa:
We did it.

Fomeros Base Commander:
Hofman, now you can come back.

Hofman:
So I see, but I have an earnest consultation.
The truth is that something serious is happening in this world...

Fomeros Base Commander:
A tragedy of 2000 years ago...?
I want to ask details of the story, but I cannot leave them alone for long.
I shall hear more at the base.

Hofman:
Yes.
I will go with the commander to the base. I'll return tomorrow, so please wait at the inn.

Rukias:
Then, today we'll have free time?

Iristelessa:
Yes. We will wait in the city until Hofman returns.

(go to Royferon, talk to Rukias)

Rukias:
I wanted to talk to you.
It's about that time distortion, we can't go to the past with that size?

Yurii:
Right. It is unfortunate.

Rukias:
Then, what can we do make that distortion bigger so that we can go to the past?

Yurii:
There are three ways.
The first is that a person who can return to the past heads to that location.

Rukias:
That's no good. First, if we have people who can return to the past, then there is no need to make that distortion big.

Yurii:
The second is to have a stronger lingering regret to the past.

Rukias:
I see it in a nightmare every night, how can I have more regret than that!
...What is the last method?

Yurii:
The third is to borrow the power of an article that links the past to the present.

Rukias:
An article...?

Yurii:
Not anything can be good.
The flow of the current time, and the flow of the changed time, something related to both of those, and furthermore, it must be an item that is full of memories...

Rukias:
...Is that so...

Yurii:
Also, if we return to the past, then the Rukias of that time is there.
If you're seen by the past Rukias...

Rukias:
Is it impossible no matter what we do...

Yurii:
Rukias...
Sir Hero, did I say something too much?

1) You really said something unnecessary
2) The reality is harsh
3) We can now analyze the the situation (*)

Yurii:
Huh? Analyze?

1) We can give up if we know the situation
2) We will bring Rukias to the past no matter what (*)

Yurii:
In other words, you intend to settle the incident before Rukias comes into contact with his past self?
...I won't say it's impossible, but there is considerable danger...

1) Even so I will do it (*)
2) We can't risk the danger

Yurii:
Understood. Then tell Rukias, and let us prepare a plan.
If we change the facts of the past, then it would be good for only you to go, but it won't become any good for Rukias' sake.

(talk to Rukias)

Yurii:
Rukias, it's about that distortion...

Rukias:
It's unreasonable any way, isn't it?

Yurii:
Did you hear the story from Sir Hero?

Rukias:
Story?

Yurii:
The truth is...

Rukias:
Then, you intend to rescue Lera in the short period of time before I appeared then?

Yuri:
Yes. It is dangerous, but that's the only way.

Rukias:
At that time, I went after Lera immediately. At most I was able to stop two or three monsters.

Yurii:
If we don't save her in that period it will be the end.
Time can only endure intervention once, we cannot go there a second time.
If that is fine...

Rukias:
...Let me think about it a little...

(talk again)

Rukias:
Hey... No, it's nothing...

1) Leave without saying a word
2) Make him talk
3) Ask if he's lost (*)

Rukias:
...Well, I am but...
Hey, I want you to answer me honestly, have I gotten stronger?

1) Yes (*)
2) No

Rukias:
...I see... I've gotten stronger even this much...
You are really amazing. You don't falter in the things you do. At least it appears so to me.
If I can become like you and decide without hesitating... I knew it, I ended up thinking too much.
I'm sorry but I still can't answer. Just give me a little more time...

(go inside jewel building and talk to Iristelessa)

Yurii:
Iris, have you been able to rest?

Iristelessa:
Although you say it's rest, I don't know what I should do...
Even though I went into this shop, I don't know what to do...

1) You can buy something
2) You can sell something
3) It can be fun just looking (*)

Iristelessa:
It is enjoyable, but...

Yurii:
Iris, have you perhaps never gone shopping before?

Iristelessa:
It's not that. But it's true that I've never bought anything outside of necessary articles.
The thing I bought that I didn't use was the pendant that I gave to Maxwell.
......Oh!

Yurii:
What's the matter?

Iristelessa:
Is it all right if I go to your guys' room at night?
Ah, it's not anything necessary so just say no if you don't want...

1) Have her visit (*)
2) Refuse

Iristelessa:
Oh, then see you tonight...

(exit building, talk to man near inn)

Man:
There was a black market exposed under the base! Now bad things won't continue.
I'll go work diligently like Meine.
Even so... the black market... I wanted to try going there before it was lost...

Merklich:
1) Ask about Meine (*)
2) Nothing

Man:
She is a woman who works very hard. If I remember right, she married the jewel shop owner?

(go to jewel shop and talk to owner)

Owner:
Our shop's jewels are fine quality.

Merklich:
1) Ask about Meine (*)
2) Nothing

Owner:
Huh, my wife's name? What do you intend to do asking about her?
My wife is innocent! She can't do anything bad!

Yurii:
Please calm down! The man who was embezzling money has already died.
We just want to know the truth. Please let us meet Meine!

Owner:
...You're not Hingistan government officials?

Yurii:
No. If you ask where we're from, it's Jewarl. We are from Monopolis.

Owner:
...I see. Then I will have her go to the inn tonight.

(rest at inn)

Yurii:
Yes.

Girl:
Umm, you wanted to talk with me...

Merklich:
1) Confirm that it's Meine (*)
2) Remain silent

Meine:
Yes, I am, but why do you need to meet me?

Yurii:
Wendy... ah, Princess Wendiana inquired.

Meine:
Princess Wendiana!? What happened to her...

Yurii:
The man called Beckel died, and Wendy wanted to know the truth.

Meine:
Beckel has died? ... Is that so?
Beckel and I left the castle as the princess's attendants. But Beckel was embezzling the campaign funds from the castle.
He said to me that the princess wasted it. But Beckel was going to kill me because I knew about the embezzlement.

Yurii:
And so you fled to this city Royferon?

Meine:
How is the princess? ...Does she resent me?

Yurii:
Wendy is not that kind of person. If we tell her that you are safe, she will surely be happy.

Meine:
I am relieved to hear that. Please tell the princess that I am living in happiness.

Yurii:
Yes.

Iristelessa:
Good evening.

Yurii:
Iris.

Iristelessa:
It is sudden, but take it off. That coat.

Yurii:
Whaat! ...Uh... that, should I... would it be better if I went outside...?

Iristelessa:
What strange thing are you imagining?
I was going to say that I will fix the torn seam on the sleeve?
If you leave it, it will become worse.

Yurii:
...Ah...ahahahaha...

Iristelessa:
...Mm. It looks like it's fine.

Yurii:
Iris, so you can sew.

Iristelessa:
I didn't know at first, but when it's needed then I did it.
Shopping is like that. I don't remember things if it's not necessary.
...But, however much I remember, it will go when I die...
If it's from now, then remembering will have meaning...

Yurii:
That reminds me, did you buy anything after all?

Iristelessa:
...Nothing. They are ready-made goods, so knowing that anyone can buy the same thing is a little...
If I'm going to have something, wouldn't it better for it to be something different from other people?

Yurii:
For it not to be the same, then you have to hand-make it yourself, right?

Iristelessa:
Handmade...? ...That would be good.
Well, I will go back now.

Yurii
Good night.

Commander 13
...Why don't you kill us?
I killed many of your allies.

First Shrine Maiden:
My dead allies won't return if I kill you.
If they did, then I would probably kill you.

Commander 13:
......

First Shrine Maiden:
As long as time cannot be turned back, dead people will not return.
Someday maybe people will be able to pass even time. But, we cannot do that.
If so, we could accept what happened in the past, and endeavor to choose the best future upon that.

First Shrine Maiden's Fairy:
That's right! Humans are amazing because they don't give up the future!

Commander 13:
......

First Shrine Maiden:
What the Infinitor is stealing is this planet's life.
If time flows in this rate then this planet will be destroyed not far from now.
Just for that we must stop it at all costs.

Commander 13:
But the Infinitor is an indestructible existence. No matter how many bodies you destroy it will be meaningless.
You cannot win against an undying opponent no matter how much you fight. Therefore I...

First Shrine Maiden's Fairy:
That's what we were saying! If you give up then it's the end!

Commander 13:
But...

First Shrine Maiden:
I have a plan. For that I need the cooperation of capable people.

Commander 13:
......

Yurii:
You look like you had a nightmare, did you have a bad dream?

1) Affirm
2) Deny (*)
3) Remain silent

Yurii:
Then that is good...

(exit room)

Iristelessa:
Good morning. It's already past noon.

Hofman:
Hey. everyone. Sorry to keep you waiting.

Rukias:
Welcome back. Now that your name is cleared, I wondered if you would go back to the army.

Yurii:
Yes, you don't need to flee any more.

Hofman:
I talked to the commander about the matter happening in the world now. So I received a special mission.
"Go together with you guys and investigate for further details."

Iristelessa:
So he believes you.

Hofman:
Yes. In time of emergency he will cooperate.
When we attack the Dragon Abyss Towers, he will be a strong ally.

Iristelessa:
We did it. Now if the Hingistan side is settled, then the preparations will be complete.

Rukias:
Then, shall we return to Monopolis?

(go to city's exit)

Hofman:
That reminds me, I have a little request...
On our way to return, can we stop by Leystan?
I want to say thanks for the person who sheltered me.

(use Transgate to Leystan)

Fomeros Army Captain:
All right? Do not let them enter the city!
Even if it means your life, stop them here!

Fomeros Soldier:
Ca-captain! They're over here too!

Red Wolf Member:
...I will help you fight...

Fomeros Army Captain:
Ah, sorry!

Rukias:
Those are... Screapers!

Yurii:
If they get into the city, it will be terrible!

Rukias:
We won't let them!

======================================
MISSION BATTLE 35 Screaper Assault
[[Clear Conditions:
- All monsters defeated

Game Over Conditions
-Screaper intrudes into city
- Death of Fomeros captain
- Death of Monopolis Red Wolf Member
- All party members defeated]]
--------------------------------------
Complete: No Fomeros soldier casualties
Clear: 1 Fomeros soldier casualty
Failed: 2-3 Fomeros soldier casualties
======================================

(after killing all regular monsters)

Yurii:
The monsters are gone! Now there are only Screapers left!

(after killing 1 Screaper)

Yurii:
There's only one left! Be careful!

(after battle)

Fomeros Army Captain:
That uniform, you're a Monopolis member?
Thank you very much!

Red Wolf Member:
I only did what I wanted to. You don't need to thank me.
...Sorry, but I'm in a hurry, so I'll excuse myself...

Fomeros Army Captain:
You too, thank you! Because of you the city was protected!
I have a report for the headquarters, so I'll take my leave!

(enter Leystan)

Hofman:
I'm sorry, but can I have a little time?

Iristelessa:
Then, shall we relax until tomorrow?

1) Agree (*)
2) We should return to headquarters quickly

Yurii:
Then, our meeting time is tomorrow morning at the inn's lobby.

(talk to Rukias)

Rukias:
About that Red Wolf member who appeared at that battle...
He was able to fight evenly with Screapers.
If I could be that strong, I wouldn't ever hesitate about anything...

(exit city)

Yurii:
Where are you going, leaving everyone behind?

1) There's something about that Red Wolf member (*)
2) No particular interest

Yurii:
Then, don't take too long so that everyone doesn't worry.

(go south, find the Red Wolf member)

Yurii:
Um... you're...?

Red Wolf Member:
...If possible... I didn't want to meet you.

Yurii:
I knew it! You're alive!

Shuweizer:
I almost died. It was too much for Shayer.
There is a mechanism confiscated from the great land village at Lennox laboratory. It seems it was used.

1) Why didn't you let us know you are alive?
2) I can imagine the reason you didn't name yourself (*)

1) It was for Anita's sake
2) So that you don't need to fight as what you did in the past
3) Strategy against the Infinitor (*)

Shuweizer:
It seems you understand.

I heard about the Infinitor from Iris. It seems my family line is the most suitable for it to possess.
If so, then when it can't use my old man's body any more, then it would directly aim for mine.
In other words, I am a spare body to him.
However the good thing is that I died from Neilis. It is probably better to keep it that way.
Furthermore... now I cannot travel through time.

Yurii:
Oh, why?

Shuweizer:
My body has returned to normal from that equipment that saved my life. It returned back to when I didn't have the time travel operation done.
So now I can't travel to the past like before.
...Well, can't help what has been done. So I decided to support from the shadows.

Yurii:
Shuweizer...

Shuweizer:
We've drawn out a long trivial talk.
All right? If you meet me again, do not talk to me at all.
And now...
...Do not tell anyone about this.

(enter inn, talk to Iristelessa)

Iristelessa:
Ah, that was right. I had something to give you.

+Obtained Amulet!+

Yurii:
It's an amulet... a handmade one too.
Iris made it?

Iristelessa:
Uh... yes...

Yurii:
There must be something inside, right? What is it...!

Iristelessa:
No, don't open it!
The blessing is weak.

Yurii:
Ah, sorry!

Iristelessa:
Well, even though I say blessing, it's not really important!
If you think it looks bad, you can throw it away!

1) I might throw it away later
2) Thank her
3) Be so happy you embrace her (*)

Iristelessa:
Wha, uh, wait! I know what your feelings are...!
When I see that person...
..Ah, anyway! ... Take care of that amulet...

(rest the night at inn)

Yurii:
Good morning, everyone.

Hofman:
Let me thank you again.
Thank you. Because of you, my name is cleared.
From now, I can help you guys without worrying about anything.
If there's anything I can help with, do feel free to say so.

Rukias:
Then, shall we depart?

Innkeeper:
Please come again.

(use Transgate to Makinus, go to Monopolis building 10F office room)

Shayer:
Enter.

Shayer:
Welcome back.
Did you hear about the result of yesterday's election?

Hofman:
No, not yet.

Shayer:
Your brother had a complete victory. Apparently you made it in time.

Hofman:
Yes. It's thanks to everyone.

Iristelessa:
Next we have to do something about Hingistan's internal conflict.

Anita:
There has not been great change on the Hingistan side.
As expected, with hiding the identity of the second prince, things probably can't move as we like.

Iristelessa:
Understood. We will go help them at once.

Hofman:
This time I will help.

Shayer:
We will have Hofman remain.

Hofman:
Huh?

Shayer:
For the time that should come, We will need to have you mediate with Fomeros. For that, there is an arrangement.
Furthermore, it's a little strange for a Fomeros soldier like you to participate in the revolution of Hingistan Kingdom.

Rukias:
Certainly if you're revealed after it would be untimely.

Hofman:
...It can't be helped... I will do what I should do as someone in the right place at the right time.
Give my regards to those two people.

Shayer:
Wendy's group should be waiting in the Hingistan capital El Hingis.
Please hear the details after you meet up with them.

(use Transgate to Leystan, go south a long way to El Hingis. activate the Transgate and enter city)

Rukias:
So this is Hingistan capital El Hingis, huh? This is the first time I've been here.

Iristelessa:
It's also my first time.

Yurii:
From what we can see, it is still quiet. Looks like we made it in time.

Iristelessa:
Yes. Then let's find those two people.

(talk to main in pink in front of inn)

Man:
Ah, you guys.

Yurii:
Huh?

Man:
It's me.

Yurii:
Disguise king?

Disguise King:
Oh, not in such a big voice, please.
If you are looking for sir Maxwell, do go to the inn.
If you show this, they will guide you.

+Obtained Rainbow Handkerchief!+

(show it to innkeeper, 七色のハンカチ)

Innkeeper:
Please come this way...

Maxwell:
Ah, you came. I heard that the Fomeros side went well.

Yurii:
Yes, Hofman's suspicion was dispelled, and the real embezzlement criminal was captured.

Rukias:
So, in emergency we can have Fomeros army cooperate.

Maxwell:
I see, that's good. Now it's just us.

Iristelessa:
Please explain the situation, Maxwell.

Maxwell:
Right.
Currently Zafreed has solid security on the castle.
If we try to penetrate it like that, we will only have futile casualties. So we have decided on diversionary tactics.
Wendy is conducting an attack on the base on Jiant Mountain. You all please go there and participate.
If you cause noise there, reinforcements from the castle will come. In that moment we will get through the castle gate.

Rukias:
So it's to make the castle soldiers gather at Jiant Mountain.

Maxwell:
Yes, however when that plan succeeds, then we also want you to participate in the battle with Zafreed.
Zafreed is the most powerful magic user in Hingistan. Resistance members cannot stand up to him.

Iristelessa:
Fight at Jiant Mountain, and then come here... Will there be enough time?

Maxwell:
You should be able to use the Transgate. Return here at once from Schizarz, and you can participate in penetrating the castle.
It's a plan where we need strength and speed. Only you guys are up to it. I'm counting on you.

(use Transgate to Schizarz, go west to Jiant, to the three soldiers standing in left)

Resistance Member:
We have been waiting.
Currently, Wendy is attacking in Jiant Mountain, and while occupying the enemy, will retreat here.
Will you participate in the plan right away?

Merklich:
1) Participate in strategy (*)
2) Still need to prepare

Resistance Member:
Then, please do your best!

Hingistan Army Captain:
They're giving us trouble, but we will strike them in one blow here!

Wendy:
Well, here we go! Everyone, do your best!

Yurii:
Wendy!

Wendy:
Everyone! You came!
You've heard the plan? First we'll fight with all our strength!

[Wendy has become an ally!]

======================================
MISSION BATTLE 36 Disrupt Hingistan's Main Forces
[[Clear Conditions
- Defeat 20 or more enemies, have 5 people reach the northern area of map, make enemy request for reinforcements

Game Over Conditions
- 3 Resistance members defeated
- All party members defeated]]
--------------------------------------
Complete: No Resistance member casualties
Clear: Suffered Resistance member casualty, defeat 25 or more enemies
Failed: Suffered Resistance member casualty, defeat 21-24 enemies
======================================

Resistance Member:
We will standby here to occupy the enemy.
If you judge that it is suitable to advance forward, please tell us.
If we exhaust their numbers and penetrate their line, they should request reinforcements from the castle!

Rukias:
While defeating the enemy we'll push into their line, and by showing our force they should withdraw from the giant, huh?

Wendy:
If five of our people reach the enemy's area, they should call for reinforcements.
Also, do not let our allies die. If too many are defeated then we won't have enough power to defend the giant.

(after killing 20 enemies)

Wendy:
That should be enough defeated! Now we will advance simultaneously we'll gain control!

(get 5 allies into top left of map)

Wendy:
We've roughly broken through the enemy line!
Now we'll just clean them up!

Hingistan Soldier:
What is this... At this rate...!
Give the signal for reinforcements!

Wendy:
Strategy's first stage is success! All members retreat!

[[Clear Conditions
- All Resistance members escape, Merklich escapes after

Game Over Conditions
- More than 3 Resistance members defeated
- All party members defeated]]

(after Resistance members exit)

Yurii:
The Resistance members have completed retreat! You all hurry too!

[[Clear Conditions
- Merklich escapes southeast

Game Over Conditions
- All party members defeated]]

(Merklich reaches exit)

Yurii:
Let's hurry to the next stage of the plan!

Hingistan Soldier:
Don't let them escape! We'll get them in a pincer attack with the reinforcement troops!

Wendy:
You worked hard. The operation was a success.
You've heard the next stage, right?

1) Hurry to El Hingis (*)
2) Confirm if the remaining soldiers are fine
3) Remain silent

Wendy:
There will be a battle with Hingistan army passing the road. It would be fine to break through them, but if it's difficult then we can take the Transgate from Schizarz.

(go east)

Wendy:
...Hehe.

Yurii:
What is it, Wendy?

Wendy:
I knew that when I'm with you, things go the best.

Yurii:
You two have acted together since before you met me.

Wendy:
Was it okay when I wasn't there?

1) Same as always
2) It was uneasy
3) Worried about Wendy (*)

Wendy:
You worried about me more than yourself? Isn't that a little impolite?
Well, it's not bad that you were worried about me...
Now I know well from acting separately this time.
I depend on you more than expected...

Yurii:
Wendy...

Wendy:
...Thank you. Let us stay like this a little...
......
Why is it?
I always thought I could do things myself.
But, when you're not there then I become insecure...
...Thank you. I'm fine already.

1) I'm glad you feel better (*)
2) You are always welcome
3) Let's get going

Wendy:
All right, let's go!

(use Transgate near Schizarz to go to El Hingis)

Wendy:
......

Merklich:
1) Ask what she is thinking
2) Say we will make the revolution a success (*)
3) Say nothing

Wendy:
...Huh? ...Ah, yes, that's right.
Because we're with you guys, it's unimaginable to fail.

Yurii:
Wendy... what really...

Wendy:
...Nothing...don't say anything.
If we came this far, there is no time to hesitate.

Yurii:
Wendy...

(go to top left of El Hingis)

Maxwell:
We'll grasp victory here!

Wendy:
Zafreed is in the throne room! Let's head straight for the highest floor!

Maxwell:
All right, let's go!

Hingistan Army Captain:
Remove the intruders!

Wendy:
If we go ahead leaving that shutter apparatus, then we'll be caught in a pincer in the middle of the way! We'll advance after we destroy it!

[[Clear Conditions
- Destroy left and right switches

Game Over Conditions
- Death of NPC
- All party members defeated]]

(destroy both switches with long range or magic)

Yurii:
Now we can prevent soldier reinforcements!
Next if we defeat all the enemies here, we won't worry about being attacked from behind!
Everyone, do your best!

[[Clear Conditions
- Defeat all enemies

Game Over Conditions
- Death of NPC
- All party members defeated]]

(after battle)

Yurii:
Now we can proceed freely.

(go through door)

Maxwell:
I cannot go further if I'm not to be revealed.
I'll only be a burden to you guys like before if I can't fight.

1) Leave it to us (*)
2) Point out Wendy is going

Maxwell:
I can only depend on you from here. I'm counting on you!

Hingistan Army Captain:
Intruders! We won't let them go further than here!

(defeat everyone, go upstairs)

Zafreed:
You've let the intruders get this far! What worthless soldiers...

Wendy:
Zafreed! This is the end of your crimes

Zafreed:
Who could this be...It's been a long time, Princess Wendiana.

Wendy:
You killed my brother and my father, and made the citizens suffer. I can't forgive you!

Zafreed:
Do you intend to take the king's position by killing me?

Wendy:
No, that's not it. I will attack you as a citizen of Hingistan!

Zafreed:
Then I will destroy all the royal blood with all my might!
I will reward those who kill them! Get them!

======================================
MISSION BATTLE 37 Hingistan's Revolution
[[Clear Conditions:
- Defeat Zafreed

Game Over Conditions
- All party members defeated]]
--------------------------------------
Complete: Defeat all enemies
Clear: Party member defeated 1 or less times before defeating Zafreed
Failed: Party member defeated 2 or more times before defeating Zafreed
======================================

Zafreed:
Raise the magic barrier!

Hingistan: Soldier:
Yes sir! We will put up the magic barrier!

Wendy:
If we don't defeat those magic users, we can't get to Zafreed!

(after a while)

Hingistan Soldier:
...Soul's connection...

Hingistan Soldier:
...Answer our voice, revive our friend's soul again...!

Yurii:
They revived their ally!?

(all magic users defeated)

Hingistan Soldier:
Lord Zafreed... I'm sorry...

Zafreed:
What! My own trained magic troop!?
No, the magic barrier!

(attack Zafreed)

Zafreed:
I myself will be your opponent. The great sorceror of Hingistan!

(attack Zafreed a while)

Zafreed:
Grr! I've been cornered up to here...!

(defeat Zafreed)

Zafreed:
...Ugh, impossible... how could I...!

Resistance Member:
Oh, you did it!?

Resistance Member:
We won!

Wendy:
Your despotism ends here, Zafreed. You will be imprisoned!

Zafreed:
...Ugh...!

Rukias:
What will become of him?

Iristelessa:
It will be judged by the citizens.

Wendy:
With this Hingistan will step toward democracy.

(exit castle)

Maxwell:
Thank you. Because of you the revolution will succeed.

Wendy:
What will you do from here, brother?

Maxwell:
I will work from behind and go through the council.
More importantly now we can prepare attacking the Dragon Abyss Towers.

Iristelessa:
Yes. We will have to attack all four towers in the world at once.

Maxwell:
If I remember right, there are two in Hingistan.

Iristelessa:
We will immediately need the cooperation of the new Hingistan.

Maxwell:
When you have decided the details, do contact me right away.
That's right... please take this.

+Obtained Maxwell's Key!+

Maxwell:
Well then, I have to deal with the matters now. I'll take my leave.

(walk into city)

Wendy:
Everyone worked hard.
Tonight I will pay the inn fare, so how about we rest today?

1) Yes (*)
2) No

Wendy:
All right, we'll have free time today. Tomorrow morning meet in the lobby!

(talk to Rukias)

Rukias:
...As expected, you're incredible.
You've quietly admitted me even though I'm a child.
I can't reach your level even if I outstretch myself with all my might...
Other than your strength, you can draw in other people. You have that kind of power...
Also, you make things possible which were thought to be impossible... I have no chance of winning against you.

1) Be arrogant
2) Be modest (*)
3) Remain silent

Rukias:
Certainly when your friends recognize your strength it's fine for you to be proud, you know.
...Well, there is only one chance.
If I could try over again many times to save Lera, I wouldn't be this scared.

1) Do you intend to throw away that chance?
2) Right from the start, that chance didn't exist
3) One chance is enough (*)

Rukias:
As expected of you. Your ability to be decisive is amazing to me.
Thank you for everything. I won't make your advice futile, I'll think of the best way.
Sorry but can you let me be alone a bit?

(talk to Wendy in the castle)

Yurii:
Wendy, is something the matter?

Wendy:
...The revolution has ended...
From now we will make the country a democracy.
Maxwellart will reform the country with the revolution council.
My objective at the start was to search for my brother. Having that finished, my task was to make my brother's revolution a success.
And now, that is also finished...
After that there's still the task to defeat Infinitor, but when that is ended, what will I become...?
Originally I entered Monopolis to search for my brother. I thought that my return would be to this castle.
...This castle was where I was raised. If this castle isn't my place any more, what will become of me?
When everything ends, where is my place...?

Yurii:
Wendy...

Wendy:
I thought of what I would become when everything ended...
But I couldn't find an answer...

1) You can make Monopolis your home
2) There's a place among the comrades where you should be (*)
3) You can enter the revolution council

Wendy:
Among my comrades...? Can that be called a place?
And, it's a little embarrassing, but...
I still have time to think about things. At least, until Infinitor is resolved...
Until then I'll look around so that I can find an answer.
...Thank you.
Having you listen to me has lightened my mind.

(talk again)

Yurii:
That minds me, Sir Hero. Is it all right if we tell Wendy about that matter?

Wendy:
That matter?

Yurii:
We met Meine at Royferon.

Wendy:
Meine!? And then?

Yurii:
As expected, she was almost killed because she knew about Beckel's embezzling.
Now she has married a shopkeer and is living in happiness.

Wendy:
Meine is safe... I'm so glad...
I'd like to meet her someday.

(go to Iristelessa in the inn)

Yurii:
Ah? Iris?
Are you looking at something happily? What is it?
It's hidden in your hands so I can't see anything...

1) Not interested
2) Walk up and take a look directly (*)
3) Make Yurii take a peek

Yurii:
Okay.
Iris!

Iristelessa:
Ah, you!
What business do you have?

Yurii:
Sorry for surprising you. It's just that we were wondering what you were looking at.

Iristelessa:
It has nothing to do with you!

Yurii:
It seems to have ended up bad...
But, that thing is certainly... the same amulet as Sir Hero's...

(exit the city if you want to see Shuweizer. go north and find him in the desert)

Yurii:
Shuweizer...

Shuweizer:
It looks like Hingistan's independence was a success.

Yurii:
Yes!

Shuweizer:
Let me congratulate you. You did well with just four people. As expected of the one who defeated me.
Well then, now you have successfully prepared to attack the Dragon Abyss Towers...

Yurii:
Shuweizer, what are you doing here?

Shuweizer:
I am exterminating some troublesome insects so that you guys can focus on your fight.

Yurii:
Those, could they be...

Shuweizer:
Yes, Screapers.
Be careful. They have started to appear again.

Yurii:
...Yes...

Shuweizer:
Well then, I should get going. Don't let up until it's over.

Yurii:
Shuweizer, you be careful too.

(rest at inn, he will ask again to confirm. rest on bed)

Yurii:
Sir Hero, why is it I'm a fairy? It would be good if I were a human like everyone else...

1) If you are human, we can't travel through time
2) It's a pointless thought
3) What would you like to do if you are a human? (*)

Yurii:
That's obvious!
I'd help you like everyone else! If I could fight together with you, I could protect you!
And what's more...! ...No, it's nothing...

(exit room)

Wendy:
Good morning! Well, let's return to Makinus!

(doing Wendy's sidequest instead. take Transgate to Royferon)

Wendy:
This is Royferon? ...Meine is here?

(talk to jewel owner in building)

Owner:
You are certainly...

Merklich:
1) I want to meet Meine (*)
2) No particular business

Owner:
Then I will have her meet in the inn again.

Wendy:
Tonight I can meet Meine... I wonder if she'll notice how I've grown?

1) Just show her as you are now (*)
2) I don't know

Wendy:
As I am now, what should I do...

Yurii:
How about you treat her to your cooking?

Wendy:
What! My cooking?

Yurii:
In the first place you began cooking for that, right?

Wendy:
Well, that's true but... I'm not prepared at all!
Please help me find ingredients!

(go shopping for ingredients at the item shop)

Wendy:
Do you have any ingredients for cooking?

Merchant:
Huh, cooking? I only have our own kind of seasonings...
If that is fine, I will give it to you. Because I'm in your debt.

+Obtained Seasonings!+

(go to Schizarz shop for ingredients)

Wendy:
Do you have any ingredients for cooking?

Merchant:
Huh, cooking? Then how about this small fish?
You people helped save this village before, so I'll give it to you as a present!

+Obtained Small Fish!+

Wendy:
Thank you!

(go to El Hingis shop for ingredients)

Wendy:
Do you have any ingredients for cooking?

Merchant:
Cooking, huh...
I don't know if you can use it immediately, but how about dessert?

+Obtained Hingistan Fruits!+

Merchant:
You defeated Zafreed for us.
I don't need payment.

Wendy:
Thank you!

(take transgate to Leystan, go to Transgate center to Goatland. activate Transgate near Pothrad village)

Pothrad:
Oh, it's been a while! You've finally recovered the Transgate data.

Yurii:
Huh? But if we return the Gate Opener to you, we won't be able to use them.

Pothrad:
It's fine. In exchange I prepared this ring.

+Obtained Gate Rings!+

Pothrad:
If you have those rings you can use the Transgates just like you have up to now.
Then, I'll have you return that stick.

+Returned Gate Opener!+

Pothrad:
Then, now I have it back.

Yurii:
Gate Rings... There are seven so we can give one to each person.

(talk to that Pothrad in the village)

Wendy:
Do you have anything for cooking ingredients?

Pothrad:
What, cooking? Then, use the vegetables grown in this village.
I can guarantee the flavor and nutrition of these vegetables blessed by the earth!

+Obtained Pothrad Vegetables!+

Wendy:
Thank you very much!

(stay at inn at Royferon)

Wendy:
We've somehow gathered various ingredients. Thank you!
Then, I will borrow the kitchen, you can go ahead to your room!

Yurii:
Yes, come in.

Meine:
Ah, is there a matter this time?

Yurii:
Actually, there is someone who wants to meet you.

Meine:
Who could it be?

Yurii:
It's...

Wendy:
I made you wait!

Meine:
Huh?

Wendy:
Meine!

Meine:
Princess! Ah, I am sorry. Originally I'm supposed to be the one visiting you...

Wendy:
It's fine, Meine. It's enough that you were safe.
Moreover, I'm not a princess any more, so you don't have to worry so much.

Meine:
Then, the revolution was a true story...

Wendy:
How about you?

Meine:
Thanks to you, I am this way. I've been able to be in a good home.

Wendy:
I'm very glad for that.
By the way, I have something I want you to see...

Meine:
For me?

Wendy:
This...
In that time I couldn't do anything, but I...

Meine:
I will accept it gratefully.
Thank you for the treat.

Wendy:
How was it?

Meine:
It was full of heart. It could convey the princess's care.
Even if I wasn't there, you have really grown.

Wendy:
Because you were there, because I wanted to make you relax, I began cooking.
It's thanks to you that I'm here. Thank you.

Meine:
To be able to see how the princess grew, today's a really good day.
I am sorry but I have work at the shop, but I don't want to part...

Wendy:
Yes, I'm glad too. I'll come meet you again!

Meine:
Yes, I will wait for you.

Wendy:
Thank you, everyone. I feel like something in my heart has lifted.
Thank you very much!

(use Transgate to Makinus)

Rukias:
What!? These things...!

Yurii:
Screapers!

Wendy:
It will be terrible if they get inside the city! Let's destroy them here!

======================================
MISSION BATTLE 38 Truth of Pollumine
[[Clear Condiitons
- Defeat all Screapers

Game Over Conditions
- Screaper invades Makinus
- Death of NPC
- All party members defeated]]
--------------------------------------
Complete: Defeat all enemies
Clear: ---
Failed: ---
======================================

Child:
Waah, mother!

Yurii:
A child outside of town! Save him!

(defeat all Screapers)

Child:
Thank you, you guys!

Yurii:
Looks like they're all gone...

Wendy:
Why are there suddenly Screapers? There are Pollumine trees over there...

1) They developed resistance
2) It didn't have any effect right from the beginning (*)
3) Reason is unknown

Wendy:
No! That can't be!

Rukias:
And your proof? Is it that Monopolis said so?
I also think that those trees have no effect on Screapers.

Iristelessa:
I think it's theoretically possible to keep Screapers away by putting out a frequency that they dislike.
However there is doubt on whether Pollumine has that function.

Wendy:
Iris too...?

Iristelessa:
In the first place, the one who developed those trees was the past commander who was possessed by Infinitor.
And Screapers are biological weapons produced by Infinitor 2000 years ago to kill humans.
It's possible that the Infinitor can command the Screapers not to come near the trees.

Yurii:
I'm sorry to interrupt your conversation, but rather than discussing here, how about we report to Anita and have an investigation?

Rukias:
That sounds good.

(go to Monopolis headquarters elevator)

Hofman:
Oh!

Wendy:
Hello Hofman, it's been a while.

Hofman:
It looks like the Hingistan revolution was a success.

Wendy:
Yes, everything is fine.
More importantly, a different problem has risen. Is Anita there?

Hofman:
Yes. Just a while ago I was with her in the 10th floor office. She should still be there.

Wendy:
Then, Hofman come with us too.

(go to 10F office)

Shayer:
Enter.

Wendy:
Excuse us.

Shayer:
Welcome back. The Hingistan side went well?

Wendy:
Yes. Currently my brother is being a representative of the citizens and preparing the revolution council.

Anita:
Then, in a little while the attack on the Dragon Abyss Towers will be put in order.
I was discussing with Shayer about the tower on the sealed continent.

Rukias:
Excuse me, but before that we have another report. Right outside the city, Screapers attacked even though there are Pollumine trees.

Anita:
Screapers... So they've appeared...

Rukias:
What is it, you're unexpectedly calm.

Anita:
Actually it's that while you were all out, I told the researchers to recheck my father's... Infinitor's leftover research.
The result was the real objective of Pollumine has been revealed.

Wendy:
Real objective?

Anita:
Pollumine was not proven to ward off Screapers.

Iristelessa:
It's as we deducted.
Then how about the effect of removing pollution from the land?

Anita:
As you know, Pollumine absorbs the land's pollution matter from the roots, and it's said to be stored inside its fruits.
However, the real objective of the trees was not that.

Wendy:
Removing pollution is not their real objective... Then what is?

Anita:
It's to absorb the land's power and store it in the fruits.

Wendy:
It's not pollution matter gathered up in those fruits?

Anita:
Immediately after my father gave the seat of commander to my brother, the Pollumine fruits, which were supposed to have pollution matter stored, were all taken away.
And then from the results of analyzing the fruits, it was not pollution in them, but a high concentrated magic power was detected.

Iristelessa:
To gather and take away this land's energy was the Infinitor's objective...
The Dragon Abyss Towers draw energy from the earth as well. It's all coherent to his objective.

1) What does he intend to do with the gathered energy? (*)
2) Look at everyone's reactions
3) Why does he want to absorb the energy?

Iristelessa:
Well, I don't know that much. But there's no use thinking about after it's taken. When it is, this planet will end.

Anita:
Then, how does he intend to take it away?

Iristelessa:
Perhaps in the celestial ship which he came here with.

Anita:
...celestial ship... Where is that?

Iristelessa:
The legend of my village is that it was sunken deep in the ocean by the Dragon Orb's power.
The reason that the Infinitor got me and the Dragon Orb is there.

Anita:
By making Iris use the Dragon Orb's power he intended to make her raise the ship back up.

Iristelessa:
Yes.

1) Agree
2) What about the Screapers?
3) What about the tower on the sealed continent? (*)

Yurii:
I have an idea of where that tower is.
You may know already but there is an organization called the Peace Maintenance Brigade.

Wendy:
We'll request those people, right? The ones that defeated the Queen Screaper!

Yurii:
Yes. If we explain, I think they will understand well.

Anita:
Then, let's depart immediately.
Merklich, I will leave your team selection to you.

(select party. use Transgate to Pothrad village. use Steed express to PMB. go to Fanille's lab)

Fanille:
...With this I can extract the poison.
But, the way to destroy the essential cells...

Yurii:
Fanille, what is the matter?

Fanille:
Ah, you guys...

Yurii:
That's a Pollumine seed. But it looks quite changed

Fanille:
Yes. it's the seed I got from you, but it absorbed a designated item, and it has a storing property.
By using that property, I'm trying to remodify it to only extract poison.

Yurii:
Only poison?

Fanille:
Now this Pollumine type will only absorb a certain deadly poison.

Yurii:
Deadly poison... Has someone been infected with such a thing?

Fanille:
To help Haschen, you gave me the Pollumine seed without saying anything...
Please don't tell anyone, okay?

1) I can't promise that
2) Promise (*)

Fanille:
Thank you very much.
The truth is that in Haschen's body, there are Screaper cells implanted.

Yurii:
What! Screaper cells in Korin's hero...

Fanille:
More accurately it's the fusion of human and Screaper cells, called the Zero cell.
Those cells saved Haschen from the verge of death, and gave him the ability to weaken Screapers with an ultrasonic wave.

Yurii:
...But that's not all, right?

Fanille:
Yes. In those cells are Screaper cells.
If he has an outside supply of pure energy it would be fine, but if the body can't resist any more it would become a Screaper.

Yurii:
No way!

Fanille:
To control the multiplication of the implanted Screaper cells, cells that secrete a powerful poison were also implanted.
And the antidote to that strong of a poison to kill Screaper cells is not made in this Maintenance Brigade....
...He also needs to replenish highly pure energy from an outside source, and raising the immunization ability will only counteract it.

Yurii:
If that energy can be supplemented...

Fanille:
...That strong of a pure energy is called vital energy, and it's the life extracted from humans. It can only be volitional energy.

Yurii:
Oh no... then Korin's hero is...

Fanile:
Yurii, please don't worry. The Zero cells in Haschen are now stopped in time by a spell to freeze time.
To sustain that spell, it uses the magic that fairies put out from plants, mana.

Yurii:
Then, Korin doesn't separate from her hero because of this...

Fanille:
Yes. Haschen's life is because of Korin.
I want to remove the Zero Cell from Haschen's body!

Yurii:
Fanille....

Fanille:
It's rude of me to request this, but I don't know anyone else besides you from the other continent.
If there is a facility where they research medicine on that continent, can I have you bring me there? Please!

(exit lab)

Yurii:
About introducing a research center, how about the one belonging to Monopolis?
Once we return to headquarters, let's obtain permission from Shayer.

(or if Anita is in party)
Anita:
About introducing a research center, let's introduce her to the laboratory at Monopolis.
Once we return to headquarters, we'll have to confirm the situation of the laboratory by Shayer...

(you can go to Monopolis and ask Shayer now. if you do so, read on. if not, skip to "001" you can ask permission later, and dialogues will be slightly different.

use Steed to Pothrad village, Transgate to Makinus, Monopolis headquarters 10F)

Shayer:
Enter.

Shayer:
What's the matter?

Yurii:
Shayer, a researcher on Goatland would like to see the laboratory, would it be all right?

Shayer:
It isn't inconvenient, but what would that person's business be?

Yurii:
That's...

Shayer:
...So it's a promise to keep it a secret, huh?

Yurii:
...Yes.

Shayer:
...I'll trust you. I will send word to the laboratory in advance.

Yurii:
Thank you very much!

Shayer:
So please take that researcher to the laboratory at any time.

(or if Anita is in party)

Anita:
Shayer...

Shayer:
Miss Anita, what is the matter?

Anita:
A researcher on Goatland would like to see our laboratory, would it be all right?

Shayer:
What would that person like to do?

Anita:
That's...

Shayer:
...So it's a promise to keep it a secret, huh?

Anita:
Shayer...

Shayer:
I don't have a particular reason to refuse. If you trust that person then please introduce them.
I will send word to the laboratory in advance.

Anita:
Thank you, Shayer.

(go back to Fanille)

Yurii:
Fanille, sorry to keep you waiting.

Fanille:
Yurii, is it perhaps that you can bring me to the research center there now?

Yurii:
Yes, we received permission from there. Shall we go to the research center immediately?

Fanille:
...Permission.
I forgot! I also have to get permission to leave the PMB!
I have to go see Krious!
...I made you take the time and effort... I'm just no good.

Yurii:
...Fanille, is it difficult to get permission?

Fanille:
...No, if I talk to Krious, I think it will be simple, but...

Yurii:
Then let us go. As soon as Fanille is done with preparations.

Fanille:
The preparations are done. Then, let's go to Krious.

(go to PMB headquarters gate)

Korin:
Ugh! It's Yurii isn't it... and Fanille?

Fanille:
Korin, thank you for your help to Haschen.

Haschen:
Fanille, why are you with them?

Fanille:
I'm going to have them show me the research facility on the other continent!

Korin:
Fanille, I don't know what you mean...

Fanille:
Umm, well...
And that's it!

Korin:
Really?! A way to remove those cells from his body?!

Fanille:
I still have to work on it. In order to do so then I want to go to the other continent.

Korin:
Is that so... Fanille, keep working hard!

Fanille:
Yes! So now I have to get permission from Krious to leave the PMB.

Yurii:
Miss Fanille, we also came to talk to Krious about something important.

Fanille:
I see. I'm sorry. I was getting too excited by myself.

Korin:
That's like you. But you've also grown, to dare to go to an outside continent.

Haschen:
Yes, that's right.
You and everyone here all have to talk to Krious so let's go together. I'll have the gate opened.
Open up!

(enter PMB headquarters)

Haschen:
You probably know, but Krious' office is on the second floor.

(go to Krious' office)

Krious:
You can enter.

Krious:
What's the matter, in such a big group?

Haschen:
It seems they have important news.

Fanille:
If it's long, shall I leave?

Yurii:
No, I think it's better if Fanille also hears it.

Fanille:
Me too?

Yurii:
Yes. Tell your business first.

Fanille:
All right. Krious!

Krious:
What's the matter, Fanille? Seems you've got fighting spirit in your voice now.

Fanille:
I need to leave the Peace Maintenance Brigade for a while.

Krious:
Hey hey, this is sudden. What for?

Fanille:
I want to go to the other continent to find a way to cure Haschen's body.

Krious:
......
...From we can see, it looks like all the people here know about the matter of his body.

Fanille:
I decided to tell them. I'm going to have them take me to a research facility on their continent.

Krious:
...You've become bold, Fanille. I didn't expect such words from a girl like you.
I see, if you think it is best, then I'll leave it to your judgment.

Fanille:
Thank you very much, Krious!

Krious:
No need to thank me. Maybe it's now possible to cure his body.
Rather, it should be us to thank you.
Then, Fanille, go to the other continent and exchange technology information with those people.

Fanille:
Understood.

Krious:
Then, let us hear the important story from these people.

(go to "009")

(001 if you didn't go to Shayer, and just stayed in PMB and go to PMB headquarters gate)

Korin:
Ugh! It's Yurii isn't it...

Haschen:
Hi, it's been a while. You have another business?

Yurii:
It's been a while, Korin's hero. Actually, we came to talk about something important. Please take us to sir Krious.

Haschen:
Understood.
Open the gate!

(enter PMB headquarters)

Haschen:
You probably know, but Krious is in the second floor office.

(go to Krious' office)

Krious:
You can come in.
What's the matter, in such a big group?

Haschen:
It seems they have important news.

Krious:
Important news... Then shall we hear it?

(009)

Yurii:
The truth is this world is nearing danger. It's something that has continued since 2000 years ago...

Korin:
That matter of 2000 years ago, does it have to do with this sealed continent and the legend that we fairies have?

Yurii:
You know it well, Korin. It is precisely about that.

Krious:
This continent's seal was for enclosing the Queen Screaper, right?
Now that the Queen is destroyed then it's settled, isn't it?

1) Have Yurii explain
2) It is solved
3) Tell about the one who created the Queen (*)

Krious:
One who created the Queen...?

Haschen:
So that's the real issue.

Yurii:
2000 years ago, an invader appeared in a celestial ship from another planet to steal the power of this land, and he was going to return to his own planet.
That invader is Infinitor. Enemy of humanity and this planet...

Krious:
...The revived Infinitor has passed from generations of Monopolis commanders, and now using the Dragon Abyss Towers to take the land's energy...

Haschen:
Furthermore, to destroy four towers at the same time... It's a heavy task.

Krious:
I heard that the group which attacked the small country alliance suddenly began to build a tower, and that's the Dragon Abyss Tower?

Yurii:
We have already prepared to attack the other three towers. Next is only the one built on this continent.

Krious:
All right, understood. Leave this to us.
I will contact Cyriltia and Grangale.

Yurii:
Thank you very much, sir Krious.

Krious:
More importantly, is your side all right?

Yurii:
What?

Krious:
Screapers.
We are accustomed to fighting Screapers here, but on your continent you haven't had Screapers for a while, right?

Yurii:
That's certainly so...

Krious:
Then I shall introduce an expert on Screaper extermination.

Korin:
That must be...

Haschen:
...Me?

Krious:
I proclaim it an S class order. If there is request for your assistance, please make it the highest priority.

Haschen:
...Understood.
If you need my help, call me any time.

Yurii:
There, please take this. It's a Gate Ring to travel to our continent.

+Passed Gate Ring!+

Yurii:
From here there is only a gate past the Pothrad's village.

Haschen:
Understood. Then, I will return to the town.

Anita:
Then, when we've finished preparing the plan, we'll send message to you.

Krious:
Yes. We'll cooperate to save the world.

(if Fanille is here too)
Fanille:
Then, everyone, please guide me to the research center.

(talk to Krious again)

Krious:
By the way, S class order is the highest of the ranks. I've been wanting to try passing one!
So then at any rate, let us cooperate to save the world.

(exit headquarters)

	(if Fanille is not in party...)

	Fanille:
	Huh!? You're going to leave this continent?

	Haschen:
	It is if I'm summoned.

	Fanille:
	But, I'm jealous... The technology that I haven't seen...

	Korin:
	You have changed. Before you were so secluded.

	Fanille:
	That's also thanks to everyone.
	Then, I'll return to my laboratory.

Haschen:
As Krious ordered, I'll help you at any time.

(depends on who is in party at the time, makes the next comment)

Wendy (or other char):
Then, will you show us your power? If we didn't know our ally's power at a critical time, then we cannot make tactical plans.

Rukias (or other char):
Then we want to know about your power. It would be troubling if we didn't know our ally's power at a critical time.

Yurii:
Yes. Sir Hero, I also think that would be better.

Korin:
...About that, it's...
Whaat! I have to travel together with Yurii?

Yurii:
What are you dissatisfied about?

Korin:
Uh, nothing in particular.

(select party)

Expelled Character:
Then, I will return ahead of you.

Haschen:
Then, shall we go too? If you want to know about my ability...

Korin:
We have to fight Screapers!

(exit PMB)

Korin:
Ack, Screapers!

Haschen:
This is most suitable.

======================================

(when ultrasonic barrier activates)

Korin:
All right! It came!

Yurii:
That's...?

Haschen:
This is my ability, the ultrasonic barrier.
In my body there are cells that emit a sound frequency that Screapers dislike. The closer I get to Screapers, the more they will weaken.
The effective vicinity is not that wide, but I think you'll understand when you experience the results.

The field of effect is in this distance. The closer you get to me, the stronger the effect will become. Don't forget.

(after battle)

Haschen:
It's over. This is pretty good for a first time battle with you, isnt it? Please keep doing well from now on.

(use Steed to Felmentia, walk to Pothrad village)

Rukias (or other char):
...Hey, Isn't that Neilis over there...?

Yurii:
...She doesn't seem to be an enemy. And in that condition, can she not see again?

1) Have everyone wait here (*)
2) It's better not to go near her

Yurii:
Understood.
Everyone, please standby here.

(approach Neilis)

Neilis:
...This trace...
...Good, we could meet again...
I searched in Esgrentz, but I couldn't find you.
So I waited here where we first met.
Even by chance, my camera has become broken and I had a feeling that I could meet you.
But to really meet again... It seems we are bound by fate.

1) Indeed
2) It's a fated encounter (*)
3) Ask what does she want

Neilis:
...Fate...? Our meetings are decided by the world...
...Hehe, it's somehow romantic.
It can't be that you are seducing me?
It's not to respond to your seduction, but I have something to give you.

+Obtained Neilis' Knife!+

Neilis:
If you come to such a place as a Monopolis employee, there are probably some dangers.
It would be difficult to ward off danger by just one knife, but please think of it as an insurance of some sort.
...Yes, a thing that humans call an "amulet"...
...Truthfully, a long time ago, I missed my chance to give that to someone. I didn't meet him a second time.
It may be improper to give you something that I failed to give to someone else. However, I can only do that.
I rebuilt the grip, resharpened the blade, so it's something I made. It's only what I say, but my heart was put in it...
Therefore, in whatever way, I wanted you have it...
Self repairs complete... Change vision mode to normal...
...!?
You are!
W-why are you here!? Where did he go!?

1) I was here right from the start
2) I am he (*)
3) So you discovered it, huh...

Neilis:
No... I... I...
Why is it you....? I am...!!
...Aaaghhh!!

Yurii:
...Sir Hero...
I didn't think that Neilis would think that far.
There should be her memories in that knife.
A gift full of memories... What kind of life did Neilis walk?

(use Transgate outside of Pothrad village to go to Esgrentz. if Fanille is with you, take her to Lennox. if she's not, skip to "002")

Yurii:
Let's take Fanille to the research center.
The nearest cities are Makinus and Leystan.

(go to Lennox Research Center)

Fanille:
So this is the research facility! Incredible!

Yurii:
Let's go inside, Fanille.

(enter building)

Researcher:
Oh, looks like you made it.
We received word from Miss Shayer.
...So you are a researcher from the sealed continent?

Fanille:
Yes! I'm Fanille, pleased to meet you!

Researcher:
This is a laboratory where we develop products for Monopolis.
The highest level of technology of the continent is here.

Fanille:
...Amazing! If it's here then I can certainly cure Haschen's body...

Researcher:
I don't know what you want to research, but ask if you need materials or data.
I shall prepare them for you as best I can.

Fanille:
Yes. Then, please allow me right away.

(002 go to Makinus, enter city)

Korin:
Wow! What's this? What's this!?
Incredible! It's the first time I've seen a city like this.
Hey, Haschen! What is this?

Haschen:
It's also my first time here. I wouldn't know.

Korin:
Then you are too calm!
Don't act that way!

Haschen:
(Oh, man...)

Yurii:
This is Makinus. There is no advanced city like this even in this continent.

Korin:
Huh, is that so...
Hey, don't be so proud!

(go to Monopolis 10F office)

Shayer:
Enter.

Shayer:
You have returned?

Yurii:
We spoke with the people of the Peace Maintenance Brigade. It should be fine to leave it to them.

Shayer:
We did well. Then, we shall decide the simultaneous attack arrangements.
On this continent, there is one Dragon Abyss Tower in Fomeros...

Hofman:
It should be fine to leave it to the Fomeros army. When you contact them, they will immediately prepare to attack.

Shayer:
From that there is one location south of Hingistan's capital...

Wendy:
Currently the Hingistan army is in standby. If we ask my brother, they can attack immediately.

Iristelessa:
The remaining location is north of the great land village, inside the forest.

Shayer:
We'll have you all take charge of that.
Very soon we should ensure a route to penetrate through the forest.

Yurii:
Inside the forest? It's a place where we have to ensure a route?

Shayer:
If we could go near the ocean it would be fine, but Screapers gather along the beach.

Yurii:
Then we'll have to go by land... Where is that location?

Shayer:
A little south of Leystan. We have guards on patrol so you will know right away.

(if you didn't get permission for Fanille before, talk to Shayer.)

	Anita:
	Shayer...

	Shayer:
	Anita, what is the matter?

	Anita:
	A researcher on Goatland would like to see our laboratory, would it be all right?

	Shayer:
	What would that person like to do?

	Anita:
	That's...

	Shayer:
	...So it's a promise to keep it a secret.

	Anita:
	Shayer...

	Shayer:
	I don't have a particular reason to refuse. If you trust that person then please 			introduce them. I will send word to the laboratory in advance.

	Anita:
	Thank you, Shayer.

(exit room)

Yurii:
So the Screapers' movements have revived. We will probably have need of Haschen's power immediately.

(you may change party by talking to characters standing on 10F.
however, Haschen is useful for a few battles ahead.
have Rukias and Iristelessa in party for their comments at the village ahead.
use transgate to Leystan, go south and find group of people)

Yurii:
They are cutting the forest open. The Dragon Abyss Tower is inside there?

Monopolis Guard Captain:
Hello. In a little while people will be able to pass. Please wait a bit more.

Monopolis Soldier:
Aagh, they're here!

Yurii:
Screapers! We have to protect everyone!

I'll help although you didn't call me!

Yurii:
(Shuweizer...)

(if move Anita near him)

Anita:
...Huh?

Red Wolf Member:
What are you looking at? Concentrate on the enemies now...

Anita:
Y-yes!

(monsters appear)

Yurii:
Monsters! It seems we caught their attention with this noise. Please be careful!

(if Shuweizer comes close)

Red Wolf Member:
Hey. You know, huh...

Yurii:
...Yes. We didn't tell anyone.

Red Wolf Member:
Then, good...

(after battle)

Monopolis Guard Captain:
Thank you very much. Thanks to you we can continue.

Man:
All right! We've finally opened a path!

Monopolis Guard Captain:
All right! Advance at once inside, and start the next stage!

(follow them into forest. talk to worker)

Worker:
The Dragon Abyss Tower must be north of here. We'll have to clear the trees to make way to it.

(go east. have Rukias and Iristelessa in party for their comments)

Rukias:
It's been five years...

Yurii:
What's the matter?

Rukias:
Ahead of here is my birthplace. The great land village.

(go east)

Yurii:
This is... the great land village...

Iristelessa:
Yes. This is where Rukias and I were born and raised.

Yurii:
The buildings look sturdily built so it looks like they can still be used.

(walk in)

Yurii:
Iris, what's the matter?

Iristelessa:
...Here he trained himself well, and it's nostalgic.

Yurii:
Are you talking about your Brave Guard?

Iristelessa:
...It's no good.
Before an important task such as attacking the Dragon Abyss Tower, I ended up remembering him.
I have to concentrate on the battle and forget about sentimental feelings now.

(go to inn)

Inn:
There is only an inn register, no person.

Merklich:
1) Rest (*)
2) Save
3) Summon Yurii

Merklich:
1) Take a short rest
2) Rest until next day (*)

Inn:
Will you record?

Merklich:
1) Yes (*)
2) No

Yurii:
You worked hard! All the Screapers are defeated!

Haschen:
The workers should be finished soon with the tree-clearing.

Yurii:
If they're complete then we can finally penetrate the Dragon Abyss Tower.

(go west and to the group of people)

Yurii:
Ah, Miss Shayer!

Shayer:
It looks like finally our preparations to break in are put in order.

Haschen:
A short while ago Screapers appeared around here. Shall we have back-up people to stay outside?

Hofman:
That's right. So that we can concentrate on the battle ahead and not have to worry about being attacked from behind.

Shayer:
I will leave the member selection to you as you know best the members' abilities. Do select three people to go with you.

(select party)

Shayer:
It's decided. Then, the remaining members will back up the penetration troop. I will contact the three other locations to begin attack.

(going to do lots of sidequests instead now.
you need to do them in order to get all characters' endings, and we are nearing the end of game.
you may follow along or skip. to skip, go to "003".
now is the time you need to complete Haschen's quest if you're going to do it.
if you already brought Fanille to the laboratory, go to "010".
if you didn't, read on.)

(take Haschen out of party and go to Fanille)

Yurii:
Fanille, sorry to keep you waiting.

Fanille:
Yurii, is it perhaps that you can bring me to the research center there now?

Yurii:
Yes, we received permission from there. Shall we go to the research center immediately?

Fanille:
...Permission...
I forgot! I also have to get permission to leave the PMB!
I have to go see Krious!
...I made you take the time and effort... I'm just no good.

Yurii:
...Fanille, is it difficult to get permission?

Fanille:
...No, if I talk to Krious, I think it will be simple, but...

Yurii:
Then let us go. As soon as Fanille is done with preparations.

Fanille:
The preparations are done. Then, let's go to Krious.

(go to PMB headquarters gate)

Fanille:
Well, I'll go get permission right away, so please wait here.

Yurii:
All right.

Fanille:
I made you wait.
I got permission without incident, so please lead me.

(take Steed to Pothrad village. use Transgate toward Makinus, walk to Lennox)

Fanille:
So this is the research facility! Incredible!

Yurii:
Let's go inside, Fanille.

(enter building)

Researcher:
Oh, looks like you made it.
We received word from Miss Shayer.
...So you are a researcher from the sealed continent?

Fanille:
Yes! I'm Fanille, pleased to meet you!

Researcher:
This is a laboratory where we develop products for Monopolis.

I shall prepare them for you as best I can.

Fanille:
Yes. Then, please allow me right away.

(010)

(go to where Anita was confined at Lennox, check the shiny thing)

[There is a pen that emits a brilliant light]

Anita:
This is something I used. It's already broken so I left it...

Woman:
I was going to throw it away so please take it freely.

[It's a pen that cannot write, but will you take it?]
1) Yes (*)
2) No

+Obtained Unusable Pen!+

Yurii:
Anita, what kind of thoughts did you write with this pen?

Anita:
Please stop imagining strange things...

(go to the doctor in the other room)

Doctor:
Ah, it's you. After that, you didn't change?

Merklich:
1) I'm healthy
2) I want to know about the wound on my chest (*)

Doctor:
About the wound on your chest...?
Then let's go somewhere else a bit...

About that injury... You already had it when you awoke from the pod.

Yurii:
From a pod? So you awoke from inside the pod.

Doctor:
As expected you didn't remember anything? Then I'll tell you as much as I know.
By Commander Brandole's instructions, that pod was carried to the basement of this laboratory.
At that time there was no one inside the pod.
And then in two years, you were brought here on the verge of death. A broken blade was pierced in your chest, and you were in grave condition.

Yurii:
A broken blade's fragment in his chest...

Doctor:
Not even I could begin to treat it, but the commander ordered your body to be put into the pod.
And so the power of the pod slowly healed your body, and you breathed again.
The shard of the sword that was still in you had vanished completely.
Because it was terribly pierced into your chest, it left a great scar.

Yurii:
Then, Sir Hero was Iris' Brave Guard after all?

Doctor:
Iris...! That was the name you muttered incoherently.

Yurii:
Yes, it can't be mistaken.
Thank you for your time!

Doctor:
Thanks is too much for this.

Yurii:
Before you received the operation to travel through time, the reason that you had a painful expression on your face looking at the chest wound was surely because you were worrying about Iris.

(go back to laboratory and furthest top right room upstairs to find Fanille)

Fanille:
Ah, everyone!

Yurii:
Fanille, have you been able to advance your research?

Fanille:
I've generally memorized the data in this laboratory.

Researcher:
She is amazing! She can memorize everything by looking at it once!
Thanks to that we can also get an understanding of the technology on the continent that was sealed.
And so it seems she memorized an immense amount of data from this laboratory.

Yurii:
Memorized...?

Fanille:
It's one of my few special skills.

Researcher:
You don't need to be modest. Thanks to you we are able to know about the lost technology on your continent.

Yurii:
That's great, Fanille!

Fanille:
...I'm embarrassed from being flattered so much...

Researcher:
...And so now we have something to request of you guys.

Yurii:
A request?

Researcher:
We have produced a plan to cure the Zero Cell.

Yurii:
Really?

Fanille:
Yes.
I've made a plan to make a killer virus that will attack only the Zero Cell. It uses a selecting characteristic with the special subtance that Pollumine has.

Researcher:
And to do it there is something that we need. We want you get it and bring it.

Yurii:
I see. All right. Then, what is the item we need?

Researcher:
It would be better for Fanille to explain.

Fanille:
Ah, yes. The item is a moss called Posaya.
It has been found in ruins and such, it's a fairly valuable medicinal plant.
Apparently it is extinct on this continent.

Yurii:
Then we'll have to find it on the other continent.

Fanille:
Yes. And, I have an acquaintance who knows a lot about ruins.
Please pass this letter to that person.

+Obtained Fanille's Letter!+

Fanille:
His name is Randall and he lives in Juwaina village.
I'm counting on you!

Researcher:
Please leave her to me.

(put Haschen in party if you want.
use a Transgate to go to Pothrad village.
use Steed to Juwaina 「ジュワイナ前」. meet Randall)

(if Haschen is in party, read on. if not, skip to "004")

Korin:
Hello! Randall, we came to have fun!

Haschen:
Hey, we're not playing around, Korin.

Randall:
It's been a while. Is something the matter? Is the Maintenance Brigade not busy these days?

Haschen:
I'm in the middle of an S rank order. Krious and Melvina are managing the Maintenance Brigade.

Randall:
S rank? Does that have to do with your visit now?

Korin:
No, it's different. We came here to visit you and it's about him.

Randall:
Haschen? What is it?

Yurii:
The details are from Fanille, and we came with a letter from her. Please read it.

(select ファニルの手紙)

Randall:
I will take a look.
I see. So maybe those cells implanted in him will be erased. I see...

Korin:
So then Randall, about a place that has Posaya...

Randall:
...It's a mysterious moss that has resistance to poison, so it can grow in a place that has the danger of poison being emitted.
It's not a ruin, but there is a leftover mine when you exit Juwaina to the left. There are monsters called Pollutioners that spout poison in there.
Perhaps where Pollutioners are near, then maybe Posaya grows.

Korin:
Ah, the ruins of that mine.

Randall:
Yes.
In these conditions, it seems no one has seen Posaya.
Then I will accompany you. It would be faster to find Posaya that way.

Haschen:
Thank you, Randall.

Randall:
Hey, there's no need to thank me. You and I are friends, right?
Then, do call me when you are ready.

(004 if Haschen is not in party)

Randall:
Hm, what brings you here?

Yurii:
We came with a message from Fanille.

Randall:
Fanille? Is something the matter with her?

Yurii:
First, please read this letter.

(select ファニルの手紙)

Yurii:
Sir Randall?

Randall:
...Sorry. He is the son of someone who helped me so I am deeply thrilled to know that we can help him.
I am blessed if my knowledge will be helpful.
There is a ruin with Posaya.
...It's a mysterious moss that has resistance to poison, so it can grow in a place that has the danger of poison being emitted.
It's not a ruin, but there is a leftover mine when you exit Juwaina to the left. There are monsters called Pollutioners that spout poison in there.
Perhaps where Pollutioners are near, then maybe Posaya grows.

Yurii:
Remains of a mine in the west?

Randall:
Yes.
In these conditions, it seems no one has seen posaya.
Then I will accompany you. It would be faster to find Posaya that way.

Yurii:
...We are not bothering you, right?

Randall:
Bothering? Rather, I'll have you let me gladly help.

Yurii:
I see. Sir Randall, thank you very much,

Randall:
No, let me be the one to thank you.
Then, do call me when you are ready.

---

(talk again)

Randall:
Shall we go to get posaya?

1) Yes (*)
2) No

Randall:
Then, let us go to the mine remains outside of the village.

(go to mine, talk to guardperson)

Guard:
This unused mine just had a cave-in. It's very dangerous so I'm guarding so that no one enters.

Randall:
I appreciate your efforts.

Guard:
Ah, Randall. What's the matter?

Randall:
There is a plant we need in there. We'd like to enter the mine to get it.

Guard:
In the mine? It's dangerous inside.
Well, I suppose if Randall is with you then it will be fine.
Please don't be reckless.

Randall:
Thank you.
Then, let us go in.

(go to bottom floor)

Randall:
Pollutioners have an instinct to spit a harmful gas when they are attacked.
This tunnel is a closed off airspace, so it could fill with poison.
It's probably better to take the Posaya and avoid fighting them.

[The current gas density will be displayed in a gauge in the screen's right.]

[[Clear Conditions
- All enemies defeated
- Randall takes Posaya and escapes, Merklich also retreats

Game Over Conditions
- Death of Randall

Randall:
Then, I will go search for the Posaya. Please instruct me of the places you want to check.

(select one)

Randall:
Understood. I'll try investigating that area.
If you want to change the place to check, do tell me.

(you should be able to kill everything with ease. when Randall finds Posaya...)

Randall:
...This is... yes, there's no mistake! This is Posaya!

+Obtained Posaya!+

Randall:
Then, let's get out of the mine!

(exit mine with Return spell or walk out)

Randall:
We were able to obtain Posaya. I wondered if it would be helpful.

Yurii:
Yes. Sir Randall, thank you very much.

Randall:
I will return to Juwaina. If you have any troubles, do come visit me. I will help as much as I can. Well then, we'll meet again!

(use Steed to Felmentia　「フェルメンティア前」 if you want to meet more GLV characters)

(talk to the characters there)

Melvina:
I've heard about you from Krious.
I am Melvina, of the Peace Maintenance Brigade, operations division.
Currently, we are confirming the attack plans on the Dragon Abyss Tower built in the small countries alliance.
Leave it to us, and you can concentrate your attention on the towers on your continent.

Rufus:
So the fairy Yurii is accompanying you... you are Merklich, I see.
Pleased to meet you. I am Captain Rufus of Grangale kingdom.
I heard the story. Now is the time for us to join hands.
We'll destroy the Dragon Abyss Tower, and release the small country alliance.

Sherris:
I am Sherris of Cyriltia kingdom. You told us well of the crisis. We have thanks for you.
I heard from Krious, but the people who attacked the small island country seem to be the main culprit of this world crisis.
We'll destroy with our own hands the Dragon Abyss Tower and its like!

2) Old memories (7-12)
3) Comparatively new memories (13-17)
4) End

[Memory 1
I picked up this knife on the way back from battle. Compared to my weapon it is basic, but in the time I cannot use energy, it may be useful. The grip is worn down, the blade is dull, but if I repair it, then it can become like new. I will give it to him as a present. As repayment for this barrette.
At first I thought of him foolish as imitating a native person of this land, but giving things to people may be good. By just thinking of that person in this way, my chest becomes warm... What is this, this feeling? I don't know it's real shape, but it's not unpleasant.]

[Memory 2
I finally finished refining the knife. I made the grip clean, resharpened the blade.  Next was only to give this to him. But he won't return from yesterday's battle. What is it, inside this once warm chest, now I feel given up on. Could it be I'm ill..?]

[Memory 3
Seven days have passed from that day. He still will not return. He is absolutely supposed to return. It should have been like before, he is supposed to return no matter the adversity.
However, that troop led by that Shrine Maiden is certainly stronger than expected. Possibly he is... if so, I will not forgive the Shrine Maiden! I will absolutely kill her with my hands!]

[Memory 4
Why is it, Commander 13!? Why are you with the Shrine Maiden who is our enemy? It should be me that is by your side! Why that woman? Is she the culprit!? Then I will kill her! Commander 13, you are mine!]

[Memory 5
My chest hurts... Even though it wasn't cut, my chest... hurts... Why did Commander 13 strike me? I was rejected by him? When I look at this knife, although it was so comforting, now in my chest I feel abandoned. ...Am I destroyed...?]

[Memory 6
...In order to endure water pressure of 3000 meters deep, I modified my body artificially. ...One part of my memory was copied, and frozen. Memory creation... designate the great land Shrine Maiden as priority target... Memory creation... Include Commander 13 as target... Processing complete. Now I will leave the ship.]

[Memory 7
5183978 hours passed after ocean escape. ...Discovered the great land Shrine Maiden, and Commander 13 protecting her...  Hereafter, will register them as priority targets for elimination.
Result of battle, Commander 13 type... eliminated... Great land Shrine Maiden... eliminated...]

[Memory 8
8640132 hours passed after ocean escape. Target discovered... Commander 13 type... ... Eliminated... Fixed term maintenance time passage, require maintenance from technician.]

[Memory 9
12264317 hours passed after ocean escape. Target discovered... Commander 13 type... ...Eliminated...  Fixed term maintenance time passage, any more adjustment failures will bring impediment to actions. Will require emergency maintenance from technician.]

[Memory 10
14016602 hours passed after ocean escape. Target discovered... Commander 13 type... ...Eliminated...  Priority target... great land Shrine Maiden... discovered. ...Eliminated... Obtained barrier breaking ring. With this, head to sealed continent.]

[Memory 11
15768203 hours passed after ocean escape. Dragon Orb discovered... Confirm breakaway of Infinitor... Priority target... great land Shrine Maiden... eliminated. Accept priority orders from Infinitor. "Guard the Queen Screaper"]

[Memory 12
16204891 hours passed after ocean escape. Battle with Screaper Hunters. Succeed guarding Queen Screaper. Imaging system damaged... self-repair... Leg damaged... self repair... incomplete, Require urgent maintenance from technician.]

[Memory 13
Confirmed vanishing of barrier. Confirmed revival of Queen Screaper. Confirmed protecting task complete of Queen Screaper. Detect intruders on Kaiseris Island... Failed ambush attack... Request Infinitor of next orders. ...Accepted orders to capture great land Shrine Maiden.]

[Memory 14
Discovered great land Shrine Maiden... Performed backing to Shuweizer... Confirmed Commander 13 type. Shrine Maiden... failed capture, ...Noise outbreak in thought system.]

[Memory 15
Imaging system out of order... Conversation with unkown person... Thought system stable......? This is tranquility...?  Remembered feeling of when I was flesh 2000 years ago.
Resuscitation of memories from human time. I noticed that I was still holding that knife myself. Pleasant memories, painful memories... If I give this to the person who made me remember peace, will the pleasant memories win over the painful memories...?]

Memory 16
Imaging system went out of order again. And I met that same person again. ... Who could that person be? Is it because I've returned to the memory of when I was flesh that this conversation is so pleasant? ...When I am with him, I am enveloped in a feeling of happiness.
Can I meet him again? I want to know more... Yes, I shall give something... If I meet him next time, I shall definitely give him this knife. It will clear away the painful feeling of not being able to give it before.]

Memory 17
I am surprised to know that I still have flesh emotions. Very much like that time, when I gaze at this knife, I hoped to meet that person again. This knife is something I prepared to give someone a long time ago. Although it's a sad memory, the contents will be locked inside it.
However, at the same time as the sad memory, there was also supposed to be happy feelings... My emotions now are the same as the happy feeling of that time. So, the same... because of that I will give it to that person. If I do that, I may know the true nature of this feeling. The feeling of when I was human...
...Ah, I wonder if I can't meet him soon...? I will wait and look forward to that time...]

(005 go back to Makinus, go to Lennox with Haschen in party {not required}.
go to Fanille. if Haschen is not in party, skip to "006")

Korin:
Fanille, we got it!

Fanille:
Oh, Korin!

Korin:
This should do it.

Fanille:
...Yes, it should be fine now!

Korin:
Now you can cure his body, right?

Fanille:
It will take time to complete the medicine. Please come back after a while.

Korin:
All right.

(006. if Haschen is not in party...)

Yurii:
Fanille, we've returned.

Fanille:
Ah, everyone! So you were able to find it?

Yurii:
Yes. Will this be it?

Fanille:
...Yes, this will make it work!

Yurii:
With this, then Korin's hero will be...

Fanille:
It will take time to complete the medicine. Please come back with Haschen after a while.

Yurii:
All right.

(to Yurii's sidequest, assuming you talked to the old man in Schizarz about the fairy and hero.
go to Dastis library)

Dungeon Lady:
If I want information, find books. If I want books, find library.
Then, books about dungeons are...
...Not here.
In the clan's village, books about dungeons are in every house.
Excuse me.

Receptionist:
Yes, what is it?

Dungeon Lady:
I am looking for books about dungeons, do you know where they are?

Receptionist:
Books about dungeons?
What kind of things about dungeons?

Dungeon Lady:
Making them.

Receptionist:
...Umm, specialist books are on the 3rd floor, but I don't remember this library ever having such a book.

Dungeon:
N-not have?! How will I get a book about building a dungeon!

Receptionist:
They are naturally made in caves, or facilities that have become ruins due to disuse.
Those are what becomes 'dungeons' as we call them.
However, it is not ordinary for something to be built as a dungeon from the offset.
Therefore, there is no book like that.
At least, there is not in this library.

Dungeon Lady:
...Not ordinary... no, no...

Receptionist:
...Ah, miss?

Dungeon Lady:
D-don't make light of dungeons!
To make a dungeon intentionally is odd?! Bloody hell!

Receptionist:
Miss, please be quiet in the library.
...What a strange customer.

(check the bookshelf on right)

[There is a bookshelf labeled 3-B. There are 50 books on each shelf]
1) Top shelf (151-200)
2) Second shelf (101-150) (*)
3) Third shelf (51-100)
4) Bottom shelf (1-50)

[Story of the Savior of Light]

Yurii:
What, this is...!? Sir Hero, can we read this?
Thank you!

[Yurii and Merklich began reading the book.
So, the hero in the book defeated evil and led the world to peace.
But it was not specifically decided just who he spent his life with after...]

Yurii:
This publication doesn't touch on the story after. It's a little unfortunate.

(use Transgate to Schizarz, talk to that old man again)

Old Man:
It's been a while. How about it? Did you find that book?

Yurii:
We checked in the library but in that book the hero's story afterwards was omitted.

Old Man:
As expected it would be. Even though that part is not there, the story came into existence.

Yurii:
I was looking forward to it, but it's a little disappointing.

Old Man:
Then this may be helpful.

Yurii:
This is!

Old Man:
When I was a child I asked my friend and I received this remaining book.

Yurii:
Thank you very much!

(to Hofman's quest. put him and Wendy in party.
{Wendy not required} by the way remove Anita if
you want to read items about her from Nora.
go to Makinus, talk to person near crates at harbor)

Sailor:
Hm? What is it?

Hofman:
Actually I am looking for a person, but do you know a sailor named Bowman?

Sailor:
I don't know him but is it Captain Bowman?

Hofman:
I heard he was a sailor, but he became a captain...?
Then, where is Captain Bowman?

Sailor:
It's already two months ago... He was captain of the Red Wolf unit ship heading to the sealed continent, and that was his last.

Hofman:
Last, do you mean he resigned his job already?

Sailor:
Actually, it... sank.

Hofman:
Sank?

Sailor:
According to Shuweizer's report, there were only three Red Wolf member survivors.

Hofman:
Is that so... Thank you for telling me...

Sailor:
It is regrettable to tell such news to you.

Hofman:
I was certainly prepared for that kind of reason for a sailor to not return home after a long time.
However it's a lot to endure to be informed of that as the truth.
Then, how should I tell that child...?

1) You should tell the truth
2) Don't say anything yet (*)
3) Do as you think

Yurii:
That's right! It's still not confirmed that he died.

Hofman:
I see. I won't give up hope yet.
Thank you for stopping me. I would have ended up telling him.

(use Transgate to Goatland, use Steed from Pothrad village
to Rio Rey　「リオレー前」. go to beach and talk to man)

Man:
It's been a while ago but a man washed up ashore on this beach.
We took him to the hospital, but he doesn't seem to remember himself or anyone.

(go back to town into hospital. talk to doctor at counter)

Doctor:
Are you visiting somebody?

Merklich:
1) Man who lost his memory (*)
2) No particular business

Doctor:
I shall guide you to his room.

(talk to patient)

Patient:
I have seen you somewhere... It was certainly on a ship... ugh...

Wendy:
Yes, you're certainly the ship captain at that time!
You're safe, Captain Bowman!

Hofman:
Are you Captain Bowman...?

Patient:
Bowman... uhh... I can't remember...

Hofman:
How troubling... I wonder if his memories can't return somehow...

(go to Jaergen 「ヤージェン前」 by Steed if you want to see Nora)

(show her Woman's Handkerchief, 女性物のハンカチ)

Anita:
Are you all right?

Merklich:
...I'm surprised... I wondered if something happened...
I never thought I would be buried in snow.

Anita:
Ahaha... I also didn't think that snow would suddenly fall!
You turned your head in surprise and you got buried... Ahahaha...
From now you'll have to be careful when you walk under trees! Ahahaha...

Merklich:
......

Anita:
Your hair is wet. Hey, please use this.

Merklich:
...Ah, sorry. I'll gratefully borrow it.

Yurii:
So that handkerchief belonged to Anita.
And then Sir Hero borrowed it when you got smeared with snow.

(show Pressed Flower Bookmark, 押し花のしおり to Nora)

Merklich:
...If so, then you can try forecasting with this flower.

Anita:
...With a flower...?

Merklich:
Didn't you say it yourself before? You said whatever would be fine in life.
If so, then have this flower forecast everything in the future from now.
With that, you can live according to whatever results come to be.

Anita:
...That's... so reckless...

Merklich:
Living any more is painful, you don't want to think of anything, isn't that what you said?
Even so you say relying on a flower forecasting is reckless? That's inconsistent.

Anita:
...Inconsistent...?

Merklich:
...Did you finally realize?
In other words, you still have a future.
Have hope in the future. Your heart feels it, right?

Anita:
......
...Is that so...? Truly, I...

Merklich:
You realized the inconsistency. You should still have hope in the future

Anita:
......That may be so.

Merklich:
I don't know what kind of life you went through.
I'll imagine that it was a painful past enough to make you despair about the future, but you should leave it at that.
As long as there is the future, don't give it up.

Anita:
...Yes.
So that I wouldn't forget about that day, I took the flower he gave me and pressed it.
The name of that flower is Heloniopsis orientalis. In flower language it means 'hope' and 'unforgettable person'.

Yurii:
That's a memory with Sir Hero? You gave hope of life to her heart.

(show Unusable Pen, 書けないペン)

Anita:
Today a shocking incident happened. Now as I remember it, while remembering anger, I write with this pen.
It was noon today. I forgot what was the impetus, but suddenly he said this.

Merklich:
Isn't it a life that's not even 20 years long at most? ...How worthless...

Anita:
...What...!? Worthless?

Merklich:
Yes, worthless.
Don't be pessimistic just from a bitterness now. You have a future, right? Then live for the future.

Anita:
What am I to you!?

Merklich:
...I have only the past.
That past is now heading into fog.
Compared to that, you have a past and a future.

Anta:
......
I remembered the anger from the first that he declared my life to be only 20 years.
While I was thinking of making him apologize, I realized myself that I was waiting for tomorrow.
Yes, I'm still holding hope for tomorrow...He made me realize that, a special person.
And so someday, I want to become able to ask him about that time's sad expression. That's what I thought...]

Yurii:
It seems that your words influenced Anita...

(go back to Esgrentz, to Leystan, knock on leftmost door)

Boy:
Yes?

Hofman:
Hey. I found the whereabouts of your father.

Boy:
Huh, really?!

Hofman:
Your father's ship was shipwrecked. Now he is in the hospital.

Boy:
Hospital? How bad was he?

Hofman:
It seems he wasn't seriously injured. However it seems he has lost his memory.
And so, I came to borrow something from you that could bring it back.

Boy:
Something to bring it back... Wait a little!
How about this? My father's pendant.
He usually always had it, but that day he was in a hurry and went out forgetting it.

+Hofman received Captain's Pendant!+

Yurii:
If it's something that he always had, then maybe he can remember it.

Boy:
My mother and I gave that to him as a birthday present.

Hofman:
If it has memories of his family, then there must be nothing better than this.
I'll pass this to your father, and make him return his memory!

Boy:
Thank you! Please help my father!

(approach Dungeon Lady)

Dungeon Lady:
It's a busy town.
If I want information, then I should get it from people. If it's here then maybe I can obtain lots of information about dungeons.
First I must get statistics.
Excuse me.

Merchant:
Yes, what is it?

Dungeon Lady:
Can I ask you something?

Merchant:
About what kind of thing?

Dungeon Lady:
If I told you 'ideal dungeon', what kind of dungeon comes to your mind?'

Merchant:
...Huh?

Dungeon Lady:
Just that, the image of an ideal dungeon.
What's the matter?

Merchant:
No, nothing!
Sorry, but I live without any relations to dungeons.
So I don't think I can answer that kind of question.

Dungeon Lady:
Is that so...
...I thought everyone would have interest in dungeons...

Merchant:
......

Dungeon Lady:
At any rate, thank you.

Merchant:
Ah, what should I say... Please keep trying.

Dungeon Lady:
No, I'm sorry for interrupting you in the middle of work.
......?
I feel a cold glance...
Is it my imagination?
...It's my imagination.
Well, I'll have to gather information in another town!

(if you want to follow her for dungeon quest, follow along.
go to Royferon and find Dungeon Lady at the well)

Dungoen Lady:
...It's strange.
Every time I'm about to research dungeons, people's attitudes become weird.
Afterwards people generally look at me coldly.
...Why?

Boy:
That girl is weird!

Girl:
Yeah, weird!

Dungeon Lady:
How rude!
I was offering the most enjoyable topic in the world and they have that attitude!
I will stop researching any more! Even if I tried more than this, it won't do any good!
I will triumph!
Look here, you people who turn away from me coldly every time I talk about dungeons!
I will make you recognize dungeons as the most supreme buildings in this world!
Deciding that, I will first gather materials!
Is there any place I can procure inexpensive things?
If I remember right, in that city's dump area there seems to be a lot of things that could be used...
First, I'll go there!

(go to Dastis, dump area)

Dungeon Lady:
Hmm, just garbage. There isn't anything good.
But, my money is limited, if I don't economize, then...
If only my sister who is good at saving was here at such a time...
A coal mine...?
...If I take only a little it wouldn't be noticed.
...My proposition today is, 'if it's for my objective, I'll try anything'!
All you good kids, don't copy me!
Well, let's go!

Yurii:
...What is that all about?

(exit Dastis and enter again)

Boy:
Hey hey, do you know? A burglar wearing red came out of the coal mine!
But the thing she stole was a hard rock that was blocking the mining.
My brother who works in the coal mine was glad.

Dungeon Girl:
It was my sister...

Boy:
Ah, the red clothed person!

Dungeon Girl:
It's not me!
It was my sister.
So, where did she go?

Boy:
I saw her in the mine, but she said strange words like, "Next material, plans", and disappeared.

Dungeon Girl:
...Then, she's not in this town any more...

Yurii:
Ah, are you all right?

Dungeon Girl:
Yes, I'm fine. It looks like I missed my sister, so I'm just a little disappointed.

Yurii:
I see. We should find your sister quickly.

Dungeon Girl:
Thank you very much.
I will go to another place to look. Bye now.
...Plans, huh? Where is a place with planning technology?

Boy:
You should find that girl.

(if Haschen is in party...)

Korin:
......

Yurii:
What's the matter, Korin? Your face has stiffened.

Korin:
...Nothing really.
(...We're looking for that girl again, huh? She doesn't learn...)

(go to Lennox Research Center)

Dungeon Lady:
Dungeon plan's, huh...
The dungeon I created before was the "changing dungeon" of legend.
So the entrance was a well, and it was perfect up to that.
...The reason it failed was that it was 11 floors and incomplete. And it didn't have a boss.
Even if I can take care of the amount of floors, I don't know what to do about a boss... I can't do anything by myself...

Yurii:
That person in red is... the sister of the girl we met in Dastis.

Dungeon Lady:
That's right! If I have that rod!
The Dungeon Master's Rod, passed down in the clan!
But only the leader can use it.
...When I someday become leader then I can use it and there will be no problem at all!
Huhuhu, this is also for the sake of the dungeon... to create the greatest dungeon ever...!
Munya munya munya pachocho!

Yurii:
Somehow, I feel an uneasy atmosphere begin to envelop...

Dungeon Lady:
Now that's decided, I will go back home!
Just wait, little sister! Big sister will do it!

Yurii:
Ah, umm, wait!

Dungeon Lady:
Munya munya pachocho!

Yurii:
...I have a feeling this is going in a bad direction...
We'd better tell the little sister if we find her.
I wonder where did she go?

(going back to Haschen's sidequest, enter lab
and go to Fanille with Haschen in party)

Fanille:
Haschen, you came at a good time!

Korin:
From your attitude, it looks like you finished it, Fanille?

Fanille:
Yes! I completed it a moment ago!

Korin:
All right!

Fanille:
Then, let me explain the contents simply.
The Zero Cell is implanted in Haschen's body, and it's the fusion of Screaper and human cells.
To prevent the Screaper cells from multiplying, the cells secret a deadly poison to kill the Screaper cells.
The medicine I made will attack only the Zero Cells. The medicine has one more effect, to make the attacked targets change.
From this it will recognize the Zero Cell, which had been adapted into the body, as a foreign matter, and attack it so that it evacuates.

Korin:
......

Fanille:
At that time you'll drink this medicine, it makes the immunization power become augmented. It will attack a second stage, and exterminate the Zero Cells.

Korin:
...Is that so. You're amazing, Fanille.

Yurii:
You say so even though you don't understand what it is...

Korin:
And then, I'll have Korin separate from Haschen.

Korin:
W-why?!

Fanille:
In the time of using the medicine, the essentials cells cannot be exterminated from the effects of the 'frozen time'.
The cells are rooted in, so it will take time to exterminate them.
In that span of time, the poison secreted will be absorbed by this modified Pollumine.
Therefore, we need to have Korin away.

Korin:
...Is that so, then it can't be helped.

Fanille:
And that's the explanation.
...I have something that I have to tell everyone beforehand.

Korin:
What is it, Fanille?

Fanille:
It may adversely affect Haschen's mission.
When you drink this remedy, then the ultrasonic barrier, in other words your ability to weaken Screapers, will be lost.

Haschen:
I see. I was dispatched as a specialist in exterminating Screapers, so if I lose that essential ability then it would be bad.

Fanille:
...If it will hinder you, then I think it would be better to postpone drinking the remedy.

Haschen:
Then it may be better to postpone it. It's better to have this ability to kill Screapers.
Moreover if I lose the ability, then accompanying you guys will become meaningless.

1) Even so you should drink it
2) It's not just for that ability that I depend on you (*)
3) Delay it

Haschen:
...Having you say that to me, I appreciate it.
...All right.
Fanille, if you please.

Fanille:
Everyone, please wait outside the medical room.

Korin:
...Fanille, so this remedy will really work, huh?

Fanille:
I can't say it absolutely. It's never been done before.

Haschen:
Believe in Fanille. Sorry, but give me some time.

1) Hurry
2) We will be waiting (*)
3) We don't have time for that
4) Say nothing

Haschen:
Okay. I'll certainly return.

Yurii:
Look, how long do you intend to stay here? If you're here it will disturb them. Go outside.

Korin:
Ah, wait! Haschen!

+3 Days Later+

Korin:
Is he all right... is he all right...?

Yurii:
...Even three days is not enough, huh?
How about you calm down a little, Korin? Believe in your hero.

Korin:
Even if you say that to me, I have to worry about something that is worrying so I can't help it!

Yurii:
...Sigh.

Fanille:
Sorry to keep you waiting so long.

Korin:
Fanille! Hey, about him! How is he!?

Fanille:
Ah, please calm down, Korin.
Haschen, please come in.

Haschen:
I kept you waiting.

Korin:
...Ah! Are you okay? Are you all right?

Haschen:
Korin, I'm fine.

Korin:
...Ah.
...Then, Fanille succeeded?

Fanille:
Yes, it was a success!
From the killer virus, the attack on the Zero Cell was confirmed. The poison secretion was taken care of, and there is no worry about side effects from the medicine.
The root of the cells is deep, so it will take up to one month to completely exterminate them, but you can live normally again so it will be fine.

Haschen:
It looks like I took a lot of your time. Let me work hard to make it up to you.

(exit room)

Fanille:
Then, I think I will stay here a while and learn more technology.

Korin:
...I see.
Haschen will be fine even if I'm not by him, so maybe I can go spend time with fellow girls.
By that conclusion, I'll also stay here.

Fanille:
Is that all right, Haschen?

Haschen:
I don't mind. I don't have to worry any more, so it would be good for her to stretch out and enjoy herself.

Korin:
That's right!

Fanille:
...Okay.
Then, everyone, please do your best.
Let's go, Korin.

Korin:
See you soon, everyone!

(follow Fanille to room)

Fanille:
That reminds me... Is it all right if I ask one question?

Yurii:
Yes, what is it?

Fanille:
On this continent, is there no monster called the elephant pig?

Yurii:
I'm sorry but I have not heard of it...

Fanille:
As I thought, they're already extinct on this continent...

Yurii:
What about that monster?

Fanille:
There is a secret cave south of Jaergen, and the mechanism that opens and shuts the hidden door is made from the organ of elephant pigs.
As a researcher, I wanted to try to reproduce that contrivance, but it's unfortunate...

Yurii:
Such a mechanism is south of Jaergen...

Fanille:
If you go there, please try to test it. If you use white rose perfume, the door will open.

(back to dungeon lady quest, go to Schizarz)

Dungeon Girl:
...She's not even at this well.
Where have you gone, sister...
Ah, you people are from before.

Yurii:
Ah, little sister! We finally found you!

Dungeon Girl:
W-what's the matter?

Yurii:
We saw your older sister!

Dungeon Girl:
R-really!?

Yurii:
Yes.
But she chanted a strange spell and disappeared.

Dungeon Girl:
...I see. She went off somewhere again.

Yurii:
And so, there is something I want to ask. Do you know of something called the Dungeon Master's Rod?

Dungeon Girl:
What! The Dungeon Master's Rod!
Where did you hear about that!

Yurii:
She said to herself in a loud voice that if she had that, she can create the greatest dungeon, and then she disappeared.
Accurately, she said "Just wait, little sister! big sister will do it!"

Dungeon Girl:
What! Saying such a thing in a big voice, how embarrassing...

Yurii:
Then, that rod is...?

Dungeon Girl:
...The Dungeon Master's Rod is our clan's treasure. We make our livelihood creating dungeons.
The creator of the greatest dungeon is called the Dungeon Master, and becomes leader of the clan.
The leader's proof is the holy treasure Dungeon Master's Rod.
...To take that treasure... sister, what are you thinking...

Yurii:
If she has that, then she can create the greatest dungeon?

Dungeon Girl:
It's a little long, but will you listen?

1) Yes (*)
2) No

Dungeon Girl:
A very long time ago, there was a Dungeon Devil in this world.
The Devil hurts people who are lost in dungeons, and becomes strong feeding on that grief.
However, natural dungeons are exalted places to polish oneself, a place of enlightenment.
Anyone who meets their true self inside a dungeon will know the truth of this world...
It's the evil Devil that wants to use dungeons to hurt other people.
The dungeon god chose one hero from our clan, and sealed the devil in the rod.
Since then, the most excelling person among our clan is granted the rod, and guards the devil.
Therefore, if a person who has no power holds the rod, then conversely that person will be manipulated by the devil's power!

Yurii:
And she intends to take such a dangerous item!? Won't she be manipulated by the devil?

Dungeon Girl:
Even so, my sister has considerable ability among our clan to to create dungeons.
Before she took the leader's trial she obtained qualification to receive the test, but...
When it comes to dungeons, she doesn't think about the surrounding hindrances, and...

Yurii:
...Excuse me, but that person became a high candidate for leader, right...

Dungeon Girl:
You are quite right. But it's all from my sister's passion toward dungeons.
Her feelings toward dungeons perhaps towers even above the whole clan.
Because of that, when it comes to dungeons, she doesn't even look around her!
Certainly now, even more than passing the test, she only cares about building the greatest dungeon...

Yurii:
That reminds me, when she talked about the rod, she said "someday I will become leader and use it".
It seems she already became leader inside her mind and could take the Dungeon Master's Rod.

Dungeon Girl:
Oh, sister!
If that's it she'll fail the trial!
Moreover if she takes the clan's treasure so selfishly then she won't be able to take the leader's trial!

Yurii:
She is mistaking what is important. Is there somehow a way we can stop her from getting the Dungeon Master's Rod?

Dungeon Girl:
I don't know if we'll be in time, but I will try going back to the village!
Ah, Dungeon God, please return me to the village!
...Munya munya munya pachocho!

Yurii:
She disappeared like her sister...

(back to Hofman's quest, use Transgate to Goatland and
Steed to Rio Rey 「リオレー前」.
go to hospital and see the man who lost his memory)

Patient:
What is it?

Hofman:
Do you remember this?

Patient:
This pendant... somehow... gives a nostalgic feeling...
...Where was it? When I got this, I was engulfed in happiness...

Hofman:
Who did you get it from?

Patient:
From who...?
...That's right... I got it from someone. It was a birthday...
...Birthday...? Whose.. no, it was my birthday.
...Before my eyes was the feast made by my wife, and the face of my mischievous son...
...Oh, that's right! I have a family!
My wife and child gave it to me praying for my safe voyage!

Hofman:
Can you tell me your name?

Patient:
I am Captain Bowman of Monopolis maritime department!

Hofman:
You've remembered well now. Your family in Leystan is worrying.

Captain Bowman:
I see... I made my family worry...
When I can leave from here I will return to Leystan immediately. Thank you very much!

Hofman:
You are welcome.

(leave and go back to Esgrentz. go to Leystan, talk to boy in the left house)

Boy:
Ah, did you see my father!?

Hofman:
No need to worry. His memory came back.
He's still in another continent, so I think it will take a little more time until he returns.

Boy:
I'm so glad...

Hofman:
It's because you gave me that pendant.

Boy:
Sir, thank you so very much!
I will go tell mother!

(go to Lennox laboratory for dungeon lady event)

Dungeon Lady:
Look what I did! Stealing the leader's glance was simple, simple!
That trick was like fooling a child!

Yurii:
...It looks like we're late.
Hey, wait!

Dungeon Lady:
Ugh, fairy!

Yurii:
Is it my imagination that someone doesn't have good feelings toward fairies?

Dungeon Lady:
What do you want with me?

Yurii:
Is that perhaps the Dungeon Master's Rod you have in your hand?

Dungeon Lady:
How do you know! It's a treasure handed in only my village!

Yurii:
I heard from your sister.

Dungeon Lady:
...What, is that so?
If the leader finds out, then pursuers will come after me.

Yurii:
Before that, please return it. Or else you'll be disqualified from the test!

Dungeon Lady:
...But, I need this rod for the greatest dungeon!

Yurii:
Isn't it all right to create that after the test?
Shouldn't you decide first to pass the test now?

Dungeon Lady:
But, but, but...!
I put all my heart and soul into it!
To do a shoddy job at making a dungeon is the greatest blasphemy to the Dungeon god!
In the first place dungeons have existed a long time before humans were born.
Looking at humans carrying on in business, at times they help, at times they raise,
It is much like the mother of everything in life! Dungeons are the truth of the world!
To call that dungeon a dungeon...

Yurii:
That's enough! Do not trouble your sister more than this!

Dungeon Lady:
There's no need to get angry over that!
(Fairies are prone to anger...)

Yurii:
...What did you say?
What are you doing?

Dungeon Lady:
...Munya munya munya pachocho!

Yurii:
......
She ran?
......

Mysterious Voice:
...Munya munya munya pachocho!

Dungeon Girl:
Huh? You guys?

Yurii:
Little sister?

Dungeon Girl:
Y-yes, but...
What happened?

Yurii:
Just moment ago your big sister was here with the Dungeon Master Rod!

Dungeon Girl:
What! R-really?
...When I returned to the village, the box safekeeping the rod was empty and I quickly returned here.
Sister, what are you...

Yurii:
...Do you know where she might have gone?

Dungeon Girl:
...Wells.
If she has the Dungeon Master Rod, she will do only one thing, make a dungeon!
She will choose a place to make the dungeon's entrance, it's a well!

Yurii:
...A well? Your dungeons have to be from wells?

Dungeon Girl:
No, no, no ,no...! Only my sister is particular about wells!
Our clan considers the contents of the dungeon to be its essence.

Yurii:
...Well, we'd wonder about that anyway...

Dungeon Girl:
However, my sister is determined to create the dungeon of legend.
That dungeon of legend began from a well...
Therefore my sister, without question, must be at a well.
I will go look for her!

Yurii:
Ah, wait!
...She went off.
At any rate.... the dungeon of legend is...

(go to Royferon graveyard)

Yurii:
Ah! I see the big sister in front of the well!

Dungeon Lady:
...A well in a graveyard...
This place is certainly burial grounds.
If so then this well by them is...
One meaning, nice? Dungeon that continues to the realm of dead...
If you take one step in it, the monsters inside...

Yurii:
We have found you!

Dungeon Lady:
Aaaghh, it appeared, it appeared!

Yurii:
What? What did? What appeared!?

Dungeon Lady:
...Don't scare me. I thought monsters came out from the well.
Agh, I was surprised...
...Huh?
Argh, sermoning fairy!

Yurii:
...Sermoning fairy?

Dungeon Lady:
Continuing from the blue demon, you're standing in my way again, cursed fairy!?

Yurii:
...Blue demon?

Dungeon Lady:
Blue demon. She wears a smile on her face and kicks me around, that dreaded fairy!

Yurii:
Blue... (Somehow, Korin's face comes to mind.)

Dungeon Lady:
This is my best chance to create the greatest dungeon!
Do you think you can stop me now?!
...Munya munya munya pachocho!

Yurii:
......
It seems she forgot the real objective.
The little sister said she'll make an entrance from a well, so maybe we'll find her if we go look around wells.

(or if Korin was with you...)

Yurii:
Blue demon?

Korin:
Who did you say was the blue demon?

Dungeon Lady:
You appeared!
Why is the blue demon here!

Yurii:
Korin, do you know this person?

Korin:
I know her, but we are not acquaintances!

Dungeon Lady:
How cruel is this...

Korin:
More importantly, what you are doing leaving your sister all alone!

Dungeon Lady:
...I failed the test, so now...

Korin:
...What? Failed a test?

Dungeon Lady:
So now I'm going around to make the next dungeon...

Korin:
Is that so, then...
...You think I don't know the facts!
You are running wildly and we know you stole the Dungeon Master's Rod!

Dungeon Lady:
...Munya munya munya pachocho!

Korin:
Yurii, we absolutely have to catch her!

Yurii:
I have no objection.
We will stop her at once!

(go to Schizarz, check the well)

[There is a well.]

(exit village, enter again, check the well)

[There are echoes of construction noises from inside the well.]

(003 that's it for sidequests, go back to the
party gathering past that forest cleared south
of Leystan. go northeast. enter tower)

Yurii:
I feel a strong flow of energy. It seems that it's being sent somewhere...

Rukias (or other char):
It's to the celestial ship sunken in the ocean. It will gather the earth's energy and raise the ship in one stroke.

Yurii:
Originally the celestial ship intends to take this land's energy and go home, so it's like killing two birds with one stone.
If that ship, which has energy stored in it, finally raises to the surface then Infinitor's objectives will be complete.
If we don't stop it somehow...

1) We will put an end to this for certain (*)
2) We don't have time to be talking here
3) Proceed without saying anything

Yurii:
Yes!

(walk further in)

Yurii:
An alarm...?

[Warning
Change detected in Dragon Vein energy.
There is possibility that it surpasses the tower's ability to process.
Send contact to other towers and adjust as necessary.
Will repeat...]

Yurii:
It seems someone has stopped a Dragon Abyss Tower somewhere! We also have to hurry!

(walk further in)

Soldier:
They've let enemies enter?

Soldier:
Release the Guardians!

(make two characters press the two yellow switches at almost the same time)

Soldier:
Damn it! They operated the security system? The lock on the door is released!

Soldier:
It can't be helped. Return fire!

Wendy (or other character):
Why are you helping Infinitor? That thing is the originator of the tragedy 2000 years ago!

Soldier:
Infinitor? Don't talk about something you don't know, even 2000 years ago!

Yurii:
Please listen! What you think is Brandole is not Brandole! It's Infinitor!
He possessed Brandole and wants to take this world!

Soldier:
Who would believe such preposterous nonsense!?
Moreover if the commander takes this world then it would be more beneficial to go with him!

Yurii:
...They won't understand us...

(defeat all enemies, save at save point)

[You cannot exit the Dragon Abyss Tower until it is stopped. Because of that it is recommended not to overwrite save data up to now.]

(go upstairs. approach blue light thing at right)

Rukias (or other char):
...What a bother. This type of transfer device can only transfer one person at a time.

Yurii:
We don't know what will happen if someone is transferred. We'll have to be careful when we use it.

[Do you need detailed explanation of the device here?]
1) Yes (*)
2) No

By the blue disc special transfer device, 2 other locations of the transfer device will be 1 group.
When you transfer one person with this device, the light in its center will disappear, and will become unusable again. In exchange you will become able to use the transfer devices ahead.
For example, in the case of A (light) and B (dark), A->B transfer is possible. B->A is impossible. Also when you transfer A->B, then A becomes dark, B becomes light, and then you can transfer B->A.
Furthermore, when someone is transferred ahead they will need to act alone so you will need to consider tactics to make them act or call them back.

(if someone steps on yellow pattern on floor)

[There is a switch in the middle of the pattern drawn at the floor. Will you press it?]
1) Yes (*)
2) No

(make way to top door.
in next room, switches change direction of the mechs.
go to top stairs)

Wendy (or other char):
Is this the very top floor? Where is the control center for absorbing the earth's energy...?

Rukias (or other char):
It must be that crystal in the center. I can feel the earth's power from there.

Yurii:
Then if you destroy that then the plan will be a success!
Everyone, try your hardest!
Ah, a barrier on the crystal!?
It's going to protect the crystal...

======================================
MISSION BATTLE 42 Destroy the Dragon Abyss Tower
[[Clear Conditions
- Destroy the crystal

Game Over Condtions
- Time runs out
- All party members defeated]]
--------------------------------------
Complete: Clear with time count at 3 and gauge over 1/3
Clear: Clear with time count at 1 and gauge over 2/3
Failed: Clear with time count at 1 and gauge at 2/3 or less
======================================

(attack the guarder)

Yurii:
When it receives an attack then it moves to another device... How troublesome...

(attack it again)

Yurii:
Apparently it moves to a neighboring spot. In other words, 3 other locations...
If we consider the placement of four people then we won't have to chase it!

(crystal guarder defeated)

Yurii:
The barrier guarding the crystal has disappeared!

(barrier reappears)

Yurii:
The barrier guarding the crystal has returned!

(after battle)

Yurii:
We did it!

Rukias (or other char):
The energy is stabilizing... It seems the other three locations were attacked without incident. The plan is a success.

Yurii:
If it tranquilizes at this rate, then the land's power will return to the planet.
Everyone, you really worked hard!

(exit the tower, go back to party group)

Hofman (or other char):
Ah, you're back.

Shayer:
A moment ago we've confirmed that the three other tower locations have been silenced.
For the present we have broken Infinitor's schemes.

Wendy:
Then, what is the next step? What should we do?

1) Destroy the celestial ship (*)
2) Search for Brandole
3) Follow suggestions given by the others

Iristelessa:
That's right. Infinitor will find another method to gather energy and make the celestial ship rise.
Moreover, it appears that the Infinitor's true body is inside the celestial ship.
It may have been unreasonable 2000 years ago, but now that we know the facts it must be possible to find and defeat him.

Yurii:
Therefore we'll have to destroy the ship...
However, the celestial ship is sunken to the bottom of the ocean, right? How will we destroy it?

Iristelessa:
We will raise the celestial ship.

Wendy:
Raise the ship? How?

Rukias:
The Shrine Maiden will do it, isn't it obvious? When it was still the commander, why do you think he was after the Shrine Maiden and Dragon Orb?

Iristelessa:
That is so.
Fortunately, we're near the great land village. It's the place where my power will become strongest.

Shayer:
Understood. Iristelessa, we'll leave the ship raising to you.
Merklich will give orders. Please choose the support team for the Shrine Maiden.

(select party)

Shayer:
The others will return with me. We'll observe the location of the rising ship, and prepare to immediately board it.
After you have succeeded in raising the ship, please return to headquarters.

(go southeast, east to village)

Iristelessa:
Using the Dragon Orb will manipulate the earth's power. But before that, please give me a little time.

Yurii:
Is something the matter?

Iristelessa:
I cannot fail and waste the earth's power.
I will meditate for one night at the temple, and join the earth and wavelengths.
Please come to meet me at the temple tomorrow.

Yurii:
Then let's rest here until tomorrow.

(talk to Iristelessa)

Iristelessa:
It's you...
As you can see, this temple is destroyed.
However, from inside this small shrine I feel the earth's power surging forth.
Although it's in this condition, it still hasn't lost its original function.
From now, I will spend one night to synchronize myself with the earth's power to concentrate on the celestial ship at the ocean's bottom.

1) Express thanks
2) Tell her about my real identity (*)

Iristelessa:
What?! You are... him...

Yurii:
The wound on his chest is when he rescued Iris and a broken blade pierced him.
The doctor at Monopolis research center testified to us.
It was a critical injury but it seems that sleeping inside a pod saved him.

Iristelessa:
...Is that so... I'm glad... Thank goodness...
I only thought you had died...
...After knowing the truth, I somehow feel filled with courage.
When I face against Infinitor, you always support me.
No matter how many times, you're always at my side. There is nothing else as heartening.
I will absolutely succeed in tomorrow's operation. Please look forward to it!

(talk again)

Iristelessa:
I'm grateful that you are worried about me, but I am synchronizing with the land's powers so please let me in peace.

(talk to Wendy if she's with you)

Wendy:
We've stopped the Dragon Abyss Towers and now we're aiming to raise the celestial ship. It feels like things are winding to an end.
...Either way, it's pretty amazing.
It's because of you who can draw in these members easily, isn't it?
I'm glad to be able to meet such an incredible person.

(talk to Anita if she's with you)

Anita:
At last, we are making the celestial ship rise.
You have traveled a long journey to come this far. Finally this day has come.
Compare to everyone else, I couldn't participate much in battles, so I feel like I am just a burden.

1) It can't be helped
2) There are things only Anita can do (*)
3) Say nothing

Anita:
I am glad that you say that...
I will try my best here on out too.

(talk to Rukias if he's with you)

Rukias:
...Isn't it a mess...?  Now it's like this, but this was my home.
That day five years ago, I could only flee being led by the old man's hand.
When I stand here I feel nauseous with regret...

(talk again)

Rukias:
Just to make sure, I'll tell you now. I don't mind if you encourage the Shrine Maiden, but don't bother her too much.

(talk to Hofman if he's with you)

Hofman:
Right about now, our plans are going favorably.
If we also include individual matters, Captain Bowman's memories have returned and that child doesn't have to worry.
We can only say that it's smooth sailing!
I truly have to thank you.

(talk to Haschen if he's with you)

Haschen:
What do you plan to do after this battle is over?

1) Work at Monopolis
2) Join the Peace Maintenance Brigade (*)
3) I haven't thought of it

Haschen:
The Peace Maintenance Brigade?
I was also thinking I'd want you to come to the Peace Maintenance Brigade.
If it's to you...
This is also something to talk about only after the fight is finished.

(rest at inn)

Yurii:
What's the matter, Sir Hero? It's still the middle of the night...

1) I'm concerned about the situation outside
2) I'm concerned about Yurii (*)
3) Return back to sleep immediately

Yurii:
M-me?
...I can't hide anything from you, huh?
...The truth is, I just finished reading the book that old gentleman gave us.
It was written from the point of view of the fairy that fell in love with the hero. When I read it, I ended up getting nervous.
At the very end of the story, the fairy didn't speak her heart, and lived at the hero's side the whole time.
Of course, she was still in fairy form. I knew that the story wouldn't go well.
But at the same time it's unfortunate, now it's a good thing and I'm relieved.
It's a fairy tale even though I read it thinking it was real.
If the fairy became a human at the end of the story, then I would also be strange hoping for that.
...I have the feelings of the fairy in the story, so I understand it well. She considered the hero of light as most important.
Humans are humans, fairies are fairies. If I became human just for my own ego, it would trouble the other party...

1) Agree
2) What if the other party has fallen in love as well? (*)

Yurii:
Please don't talk like that. It hurts just to imagine it...
...Will you go for a little walk? The atmosphere of walking in the night is nice.

(exit inn and approach Iristelessa)

Yurii:
Ah! Sir Hero, someone is there!
She is...

Merklich:
1) What did you come here for? (*)
2) Conclude that she's here to kill the Shrine Maiden
3) It's better for you to surrender

Neilis:
I came to protect the Shrine Maiden.

1) Doubt my ear
2) Suspect Neilis
3) Believe her (*)

Neilis:
I didn't expect you to believe an enemy's words.
The Dragon Abyss Towers are stopped, and there are persons with responsibility. Those are going to retaliate aiming for the Shrine Maiden.
Now that the towers cannot be used, only the Shrine Maiden can raise the celestial ship back up. Fortunately you decided to raise it.

1) Stop the rising process
2) Continue with raising it (*)

Yurii:
Yes. That is the only way to defeat the true form of the Infinitor in the ship...

Neilis:
It is a great gamble to work mutually with you, but if that is the only way then we cannot have the Shrine Maiden die.
If you understand that, return to the inn. The settlement with you will be inside the ship. Until then I will put it on hold.
This is the end of the conversation. If I talk more than this, my existence will be leaked. Leave this to me, and return to the inn immediately.

(rest on bed)

Infinitor:
Uuggghh! Impossible...!

Neilis:
Infinitor!

Commander 13:
Don't get in my way!

Neilis:
You traitor!

Commander 13:
No, you are just a manipulated doll with no self!
How about you try judging good and evil by yourself!

Neilis:
I have no need for that!
Aaghh!

Commander 13:
Ugh...

Infinitor:
You... you traitor! I will never forget this!

First Shrine Maiden:
...Ugh... haa, haa...

Commander 13:
Shrine Maiden!

First Shrine Maiden's Fairy:
Lady Shrine Maiden!

First Shrine Maiden:
...The seal is complete. It is thanks to you.

Commander 13:
What's the matter, hang in there!

First Shrine Maiden:
The ship is sinking... Please take the Dragon Orb and escape quickly.

Commander 13:
What are you saying! You're going to go with us!

First Shrine Maiden:
This spell completely uses my power as Shrine Maiden... I do not have long to live.
Therefore... take this Dragon Orb... to the village... and the next Shrine Maiden... This ship... is sinking...

First Shrine Maiden's Fairy:
Shrine Maiden...

Commander 13:
Understood. I'll take the Dragon Orb to land!
Hey, come with me!

Commander 13:
Hold this Dragon Orb and enter the clone pod! We can use it to escape.

Soldier:
Yes, understood.

Commander 13:
I will say it now so that anyone who wakes next will know.
From now we will live to protect the great land Shrine Maiden!
This is my order to you as your original!

Soldier:
Yes, understood!

First Shrine Maiden's Fairy:
What are you going to do?

Commander 13:
I have to detach this equipment from the ship. Enter them ahead of me.

First Shrine Maiden's Fairy:
Yes!

Commander 13:
Activate cold sleep!
Change pods to self-support mode! Release connection!
Set the shooting timer... Damn it, I'm not in time!
I'll entrust it to you, who are my other selves!

Yurii:
Good morning. Everyone is already waiting in the hall.

(exit room)

Yurii:
Good morning, everyone. Is Iristelessa finished with her preparations?

(exit inn, go to Iristelessa)

Yurii:
Iris...

Iristelessa:
Preparations are put in order.
From now, I will use the earth's power to raise the submerged celestial ship.

(anime scene)

Iristelessa:
Great mother earth, I'll have you hear my humble request. With my and your soul together, make the energy in the earth awaken. With my soul and your soul as one, raise the threat deep in the ocean.

Iristelessa:
The ship has risen. It is currently on the ocean's surface.

Rukias (or other char):
We will need a boat to get to that celestial ship. Let's return to Monopolis.

(go to Monopolis building)

Yurii:
Is it all right to report to Shayer now? Are you done with everything else?

1) Wait a little bit
2) Report immediately (*)

Yurii:
Then, let's go!

Shayer:
You've returned.
In the southeast ocean we've confirmed the celestial ship's location. Currently I am preparing a high speed boat to take you there.
It is scheduled to depart tomorrow morning so please do rest tonight.

Also, the speed boats are small so we will move in two of them.
You will be riding the first one, so consider the members that you will bring with you while you rest tonight.

1) There is the danger of Screapers (*)
2) Understood

Yurii:
If we're going by boat we might be attacked by Screapers.

Shayer:
We have requested assistance from the new Hingistan government. Right before we depart, they will attack with the giant's magic cannon.

Yurii:
The Screapers will be concentrated on by the giant?

Shayer:
Taking advantage of that, you will use a small boat that is hard to discover.
Then, I will leave tomorrow to you.

Iristelessa (or other char):
Then, we will dismiss for today.

(exit building and talk to characters)

Wendy:
Finally we'll do it tomorrow.
Ever since I met you at the research center, lots of things have happened.
The objective of my travel was only to search for my brother Maxwell, but why am I facing the world's crisis?
...What do you think?

1) It can't be helped to think about it now
2) Because everyone is needed (*)
3) Because you are strong

Wendy:
Is that so? I am needed? Then I'm glad.
As I thought, it's a glad feeling to know I'm helpful.
By the way, after this battle ends, what do you think you will do?
As a member of Monopolis, if I remain like this it will be normal.
My objective to enter the company was only to follow my brother's footsteps.
So I'll return to my country after all...

1) Suggest her to go back
2) Suggest her to remain at the Monopolis
3) Point out that she's no longer royalty (*)
4) Before that the main priority is to come back alive

Wendy:
Ah, that's right! I wonder if the place I'd return to still even remains...

(talk again)

Wendy:
That reminds me, a messenger from Meine came and sent an armor called Duo Hingis.
Meine thought about me. This is also thanks to you!

(talk to Haschen)

Yurii:
Ah, that thing in his hand... a medal...?

Haschen:
Oh, this. This is the friendship medal.

Yurii:
I have heard of it. It's from a custom of a long time ago to give to an important person, someone respected...

Haschen:
It's that medal. It has passed from hand to hand receiving those sentiments, and finally ended up in my hands.
Before I defeated the Queen, I passed it to someone. That person passed it back to me upon knowing that I was leaving the continent.

Yurii:
Then, you have to answer that person's trust, right?

Haschen:
Of course. Also to answer that, I will accomplish the goal to you guys.

1) I'm counting on you (*)
2) I don't expect anything

Haschen:
Yeah. Let me live up to your expectations.

(talk again)

Haschen:
Whether we cry or laugh, the day called today won't return a second time. Make it meaningful.

(talk to Anita)

Anita:
Merklich, what is the matter?

1) You give a different impression from when we first met (*)
2) It's unfortunate about Shuweizer
3) You aren't suitable as the commander representative

Anita:
Is that so?
...If that's true then it's because you changed me.

"The life you have now is the result of your predecessors' work. The life granted to you... I will not throw it out midway."
You probably don't remember, but those are the words you said to me.

It may be a common opinion, but your face was serious, as if you experienced it yourself.
Those words changed me.
I decided to live with all my might, so that I wouldn't be a shame to my predecessors.

My brother's death tightens my chest even now. But I will not face downward ever.

We are going to save the world immediately. Merklich, I'm counting on you.

(go to other part of town. talk to Hofman)

Yurii:
Hofman, what are you doing?

Hofman:
Ah, it's you two. I was actually remembering the events with you.

1) Many things have happened (*)
2) Must be caused by old age
3) Remain silent

Hofman:
I'm truly in your debt.
I've never seen anyone like you before. To be able to think that there is nothing impossible.

1) Agree
2) Deny (*)
3) Remain silent

Hofman:
You don't have to be modest. At least I think so.
At last tomorrow we will head to the final fight. I'm nervous... it's a strange feeling to stir up willingness.
But if we have you then we won't fail. I believe that, so let's do our best!

(talk again)

Hofman:
We'll devote our human affairs and wait for heaven's will. We'll only do what we can, right? Beyond that, whatever happens will happen.

(talk to Iristelessa)

Yurii:
Iris, what are you doing?

Iristelessa:
I am looking at the smiles of people.

Yurii:
Smiles....?

Iristelessa:
When I look at their smiles, I always think of this. I would throw my life to protect them.
But the truth is that I wanted to enter that circle. I wanted to smile with them.
I have always been suppressing that weakness with all my might.

1) Comfort her
2) There's no need to endure it anymore (*)

Iristelessa:
That's right. That's really true, right?
It is brief, but I've become able to laugh with everyone else.
Tomorrow we will board the celestial ship, and from there we won't know what will happen ahead.
However, if I can do it, I want to return home alive. I want to change that temporary happiness into an everlasting one.
Therefore, let us do our best until the end. For the smiles of the people in this city!

(talk to Rukias)

Rukias:
Say... do you remember that talk...?

Yurii:
The talk about returning to the past?

Rukias:
Yeah.
Tomorrow when we depart from here, I don't know if we can return.
So, now is the only chance. Will you go with me to the past?

1) Accept (*)
2) Refuse

Rukias:
Thank you.
Then, let's go quickly and come back!

(exit city)

[Merklich and Rukias went northeast of Leystan.]

Rukias:
The time distortion...

Yurii:
To make this distortion big, we need an item that will fulfill the condition.

Rukias:
Then I have it here.

Yurii:
A girl's handkerchief, huh? So it's this...

Rukias:
This is what Lera had in her hand.

Yurii:
It looks like the pattern has worn out.

Rukias:
It's not a pattern. It's Lera's blood.

Yurii:
I see...
It's an imprudent way to say it, but it is a suitable item to make the distortion bigger.
Please hold it and wish strongly.

Rukias:
......
...The distortion...

Yurii:
Then, let's go.

Lera:
Wait, Rukias! I will go call the guard!

Yurii:
We successfully transfered. Now, it's a match against time!

Rukias:
In the time until I come, kill all the monsters!

[[Clear Conditions
- Kill all monsters

Game Over Conditions
- All party members defeated]]

(Lera runs north)

Lera:
Wait, Rukias! I will go call the guard!

Yurii:
Lera has escaped! All right, let's clean up the remaining monsters!

(after battle)

Yurii:
You did it! Now let's hurry to the present!

Yurii:
We've returned safely.

Rukias:
...Lera's handkerchief has disappeared...
...That reminds me, after that I was chasing Lera and reunited with her when she returned with a soldier...
...It's a strange feeling... To have memories of it both ways.
I have to give my thanks to you. Thank you!

Yurii:
Then, shall we return to Makinus?

[Merklich and the others returned to Makinus.]

Rukias:
I'll thank you again. Now tonight I will sleep without having a nightmare. Thank you very much.

Yurii:
Rukias is so happy! It was truly good to have succeeded.

(attempt to rest in Monopolis dorm.
you'll receive item for Hofman if you did his quest)

Manager:
Ah, that reminds me, you know Hofman?
We received something for him. It's from the Fomeros president.

+Obtained Leviatein+

Manager:
Can I have you pass it to him? Thanks!

(talk to Hofman)

Hofman:
Huh? From my brother?

[Merklich told him about the Leviathan!]

Hofman:
It's a splendid sword. I will do my best tomorrow and live up to my brother's expectations!

(talk to Red Wolf Member near bridge)

Shuweizer:
...Hey. It's finally time, huh.
I cannot go with you, but I'll back you up as much as I can here. I will leave the final stage performance to you.

+Obtained Exhibition Item Key!+

Shuweizer:
...I'm counting on you.
Also... take care of Anita... my sister.

(go in Monopolis building 8F database room and check the dual sword display in middle of room)

[A sharp-looking weapon is being displayed.
It seems to be made of material quality not seen before.
The weapon is locked on the pedestal by a special key.]

(use the key you just got on it, 展示品のカギ, to get Merklich's final weapon)

+Obtained Sol Spectrum!+

(go rest in dorm until next day, second choice at the bed)

Yurii:
It's finally the time.

1) Let's fight to the very end (*)
2) Heavy-hearted
3) Whatever will happen will

Yurii:
Yes! We can't fail after coming this far!
I came with you up to here believing you are the hero. I am truly glad.
Well, let us go, for the sake of the future!

(exit and go to group of people)

Shayer:
Now all the members are gathered. We'll finally depart for the celestial ship.
However, all members cannot board the speed boat so we'll go in two groups.
The first one is entrusted to you. Please select three people to go with you.

(this is the last chance to do optional stuff if you want to get final equipment for other characters too.
the optional dungeon is also ready at Schizarz well.
if you want to skip and proceed in game, go to "011".
put Rukias and Anita in party)

(for Rukias' weapon, go to Leystan and talk to Lera's mother)

Lera's Mother:
Ah, Rukias. It's been a while.

Rukias:
What is Lera doing?

Lera's Mother:
She is on an errand. She's not in this town right now.
That's right, we have something we kept for you.

Rukias:
...That is...

+Obtained Fragarach!+

Lera's Mother:
Lera said that when she went somewhere that she saw in a dream, this blade was there.

Rukias:
Thank you. Give my regards to Lera.

(for Wendy's weapon, go to Resistance hideout by using Transgate to Schizarz and go west 2 maps until you see the giant.
go under it at top left.
inside the hideout, go to Maxwell's room and check the bed)

[Under the bed there is a long box that is locked.]

(select Maxwell's Key, マクスウェルのカギ)

+Obtained Heavenly Jewelled Spear!+

(for Rukias' armor, take a Transgate to Goatland and go to PMB.
find Krious at the gate.)

Yurii:
Krious, what's the matter?

Krious:
Hmm... Will you keep it just between us?

Yurii:
...Yes, what is it?

Krious:
A bandit group appearing in Grangale has made it to this town.
And so they stole a lot of ancient relics from the storage.
I want to take those back, but I don't have enough help...
Oh yes!
If it's all right, will you also participate in the search?
Of course, if you get back the stolen goods faster than us, I'll give you a reward.

Yurii:
Do you at least have information on that bandit group?

Krious:
Judging from their actions, it seems they have a hideout near Zerdok. It would probably be good to investigate that area.
Then, whichever side finds them first, it's a match! I'm counting on you.

(use Steed to Zerdok 「ゼルドック前」, don't enter city.
go northwest, west, enter cave in west, go through cave)

Bandit:
What, who are you guys!

Bandit:
It can't be the PMB guys, can it?

Bandit Leader:
They're only four people, what are you fussing about!
Just don't let even one person out alive!

[[Clear Conditions
- All enemies defeated

Game Over Conditions
- All party members defeated]]

(defeat all enemies)

+Obtained Stolen Treasure!+

Yurii:
We did it! Well, let's return to Krious!

(check the shiny spot on bookshelf. this is for Anita's armor)

+Obtained Magic Accessory Encyclopedia!+

(go to Zerdok. enter city and knock on top right door)

Woman:
I am a clothing designer.
I am very delighted to make my designs into real products.
Making things is great!
My, you have an interesting book. If it's all right, will you let me have it? Of course I will repay you.

Merklich:
1) Give the Magic Accessory Encyclopedia (*)
2) Do not give

+Passed the Magic Accessory Encyclopedia!+

Woman:
My my, there are just interesting designs!
When you join this and this...
I have confidently made something fantastic! I will give you this pattern paper as thanks!

+Obtained Holy Cape Pattern Paper!+

Woman:
It is a difficult design, so when you bring it to a top-class tailor you will need a cloth that is suitable for it.

(go east to buy white rose perfume, 白バラの香水, at the shop.
use Steed to Jaergen 「ヤージェン前」 go south to find cave.
check the pedestal)

[There is an indentation on top of the stone pillar,
and in the middle of it is a small deep hole.]

(use white rose perfume, 白バラの香水.
go through floor, on next map check the blue thing)

[There is a neatly folded cloth.
1) Take it (*)
2) Leave it there

+Obtained Holy Cloth!+

(go to Jaergen, knock on door right of the shops.)

Tailor:
If you just bring me pattern paper I will make clothes for fairies.
Ah, this is a pattern for human clothes? It's also a detailed design...
I brag this, but I am accustomed to making dolls' clothes.
Furthermore, do you have a suitable material to make this clothing?
Ah, I want to try to make it...! If it's all right will you let me make it?

Merklich:
1) Yes (*)
2) No

Tailor:
Thank you very much! I will make it right away! Ah, I'm itching to put my skill to use!

+A few hours later+

Tailor:
I made you wait! Well, here you go!

+Obtained Holy Shroud!+

(go back to PMB to Krious)

Krious:
Oh, you're already back?

+Passed stolen goods to Krious!+

Krious:
You win this match. Well, as promised I will reward you.
Considering your mission. it should be good to give you this much.

+Obtained Dispresser!+

Krious:
This seems to be an armor made by ancient sorcerers, but the size is small. We can't use it. Please take it.

(this is armor for Rukias.
for Iristelessa's final equipment, please refer to another guide, since I haven't done it.
for Merklich's and Hofman's armor you will need to fight in the Coliseum.
for Haschen's equipment you must have gotten them in GLV and transferred the data.
if you want to see the optional dungeon, go to Schizarz)

Dungeon Lady
So you've come!

Yurii:
We found you! Return the Dungeon Master's Rod to the village!

Dungeon Lady:
...Hu, huhuhu...
It's too bad, but the greatest, strongest dungeon is already completed!

Yurii:
...What... compared to Warslee, this is much worse...

Dungeon Lady:
...Grr! Is there something missing?!
You wouldn't know the greatness of this well, you fairy!
The greatness of a dungeon is in this well!
...Ah... I got distracted. Wells... are the best...

Yurii:
......
At this rate, the wells throughout the world will turn into dungeon entrances...

Dungeon Girl:
Sister!
Sister, stop it now! If you don't return the Dungeon Master's Rod quickly, it's going to get serious!

Dungeon Lady:
......Sorry, sister!
I have decided to make them see that this dungeon is the greatest!

Yurii:
...Again, your bad habit.
At any rate. even by force, we will recover the Dungeon Master's Rod.

Dungeon Lady:
It's too late! Goodbye!
At the deepest of the dungeon, I will become a god~!
Munya munya munya pachocho!

Dungeon Girl:
S-sister!

Yurii:
...She went off somewhere.

Dungeon Girl:
...She went down.
My sister is in the dungeon of this well.

Yurii:
...It's true that this is the entrance to a dungeon?

Dungeon Girl:
Yes.
......
Everyone! I don't have any place to request this, but will you bring my sister back?
At this rate, she may be expelled from the village, to say nothing of the test!
We have to recover the rod from my sister before the leader notices it has been stolen!

Yurii:
...She brought it on herself, but the situation has headed in a bad direction. We will help as much as we can, but...

Dungeon Girl:
Thank you very much!
This dungeon is made from the Dungeon Master's Rod.
We don't know what can happen, so please prepare yourselves thoroughly.
When you go into the dungeon, please tell me.
Please take care of my sister!

(talk to her again if you want to do the optional dungeon.
it's pretty long and hard.
to continue game, go back to Makinus to the group of people.
011 select party and talk to Shayer)

Shayer:
We will go as quickly as we can, so when you arrive there act immediately without waiting for the followers.
When time passes it will turn into the enemy's favor. When you enter that ship then aim directly for the power reactor.

(walk on dock)

Yurii:
Are you okay with going with these members?

1) Yes (*)
2) No

Yurii:
Then, let us depart!

Yurii:
So this is the inside of the celestial ship...

Rukias or Iristelessa:
2000 years ago, my clan's ancestors sank it to the bottom of the ocean...

Hofman (if he's with you):
I've never seen anything like this. It feels a bit strange.

Haschen (if he's with you):
So this is the ship that is the culprit of everything.

Anita (if she's with you):
Even for being sunken for 2000 years it's still in firm condition.

Yurii:
More importantly, let's destroy the ship's engines quickly. If this ship cannot be used any more then we can prevent Infinitor's objectives.

Haschen (if he's with you):
After that then we can freely fight Infinitor's real form.

Hofman (if he's with you):
First, we'll destroy what we're aiming for, and then we can deal with Infinitor's real form freely.

(walk further in)

Yurii:
Let's destroy the engines before the ship moves.
If the ship ends up moving, then it will take this planet's energy.
Everyone, let's hurry!

(check a pillar with small yellow light)

[There is a button. Will you press it?]
1) Yes (*)
2) No

(attack the device that the enemies come from.
do the same for other side. go to the big circle south)

Yurii:
What is this?
There's no response...

(go to next screen bottom left. go west)

Yurii:
Here... what exactly...

Rukias:
These are the sleeping places of the Brave Guard in the great land village...

Yurii:
Sleeping place of the Brave Guard...

[Alarm Voice
Clone soldier creation is completed. Will awaken them.]

Haschen:
Apparently they are pods to create soldiers.

(defeat the soldiers. check the control panel at right)

[There are various functions for the clone pods.]
1) Read explanation of functions (*)
2) Function explanation is unnecessary

1) Clone creation function
2) Organism repair function
3) Cold sleep function
4) Escape ship function

1)
[Clone creation function
Create clone bodies with registered DNA sample. Currently cannot exchange DNA sample.]

2)
[Organism repair function
Using technology to create clones, the body inside the pod will recover fatigue, heal wounds, and repair damages. From high speed technology, fatigue recovery will be complete in several minutes.]

3)
Cold sleep function
A state of hibernation that lowers the body's functions to an apparent death level. It will save food and fuel.]

4)
[Escape ship function
In case of emergency on this ship, there is a function to escape. In that event it will automatically set cold sleep function. Be aware of the event it is used.]

[Energy is insufficient to use the pod's functions. Please wait until charging is complete.]

(go back east. use single-person warp, press switch.
destroy all the devices. go bottom right)

Haschen:
So here is the power reactor...

Neilis:
You've come...

Yurii:
That's...

Neilis:
I'll thank you for making this ship rise. Thanks by the name of hell!

Yurii:
Our objective is to make this ship unable to move. Consider stopping the power reactor as priority over fighting the enemy!

======================================
MISSION BATTLE 43 Prevent the celestial ship from Rising
[[Clear Conditions
- Destroy the energy units and defeat Neilis

Game Over Conditions
- Time limit is up
- All party members defeated]]
--------------------------------------
Complete: Enemy reinforcements come 1-7 times
Clear: Enemy reinforcements come 8-15 times
Failed: Enemy reinforcements come 16 or more times
======================================

Yurii:
That seems to be a control unit!

(destroy a pillar)

Yurii:
One down!

Yurii:
Enemy reinforcements are being sent from the transfer gates! Please be careful!

(attack Neilis)

Neilis:
This will be your gravesite. If you can die in the place you were born, wouldn't you be satisfied?

(defeat Neilis)

Neilis:
...Body condition... considerable damage... Unable to fight more than this...

(destroy 3 pillars)

Yurii:
We're halfway there!

(destroy 5 pillars)

Yurii:
One more left! Please do your best!

(destroy all 6 pillars)

Yurii:
We did it! The power reactor control units are destroyed!

(after battle)

Monopolis Army Captain
Ohh, you did it!?

Yurii:
We have just finished the plan.

(go to pod room to save, then leave)

Yurii:
Shayer has sent many staff members on the following boats.
I think they are at the docking place so let's see them.
Also it seems we can use this room to recover. Let's go in top condition.

(go back to first map)

Yurii:
Everyone!

Shayer:
You destroyed the power reactors without waiting for followers, so you didn't waste any effort.
Next the company's soldiers will gain control of this ship. Please rest and participate.
Now we probably have time to return to land. If you return, please use the speed boat.

(go back into where the previous mission was fought)

Anita:
Father...

Brandole:
Impossibe, you've made it up to here...
I will recognize defeat of this battle.

1) It's the end already
2) Prepare yourself (*)
3) All that's left is you

Brandole:
Prepare, you say?
You don't intend to win against me, do you?

Iristelessa:
That's enough of your bluffing. If you can't use this ship, your plan is already ended!

Brandole:
Hahaha...
You still haven't realized? My secret upper hand...

Yurii:
Just what are you talking about...

Brandole:
Thinking of 2000 years ago...
Because of a traitor with the same face as you, history has gone this way...
If so, I only have to correct that history. And that will be the end of that...

Wendy:
What, you can't be...!?

Brandole:
What do you think I made experiements on my blood relationships for?
Do you think I would give that ability only to other persons?

Anita:
Then...!

Brandole:
There is no need for this history.
If I know what will occur in the future then it's possible to avoid disaster!
For example if I am to redo 2000 years, then if I think of a certain victory, it is an inexpensive compensation!

Yurii:
As I thought, time travel...!

1) 2000 years is impossible no matter how old he may be
2) It's possible with use of the Pollumine fruits (*)

Brandole:
You know it well.
This magical tree Pollumine absorbs the planet's energy.
If I use this energy, It is even possible to travel 2000 years!
If there was no Shrine Maiden 2000 years ago! If your original didn't start a rebellion!
Therefore I'll return to that time and deal with your original immediately!

Wendy:
It's serious! We have to go after him quickly!

Anita:
The limit to passing through time is within the age of the person born first.
...2000 years is...

1) Tell her about myself (*)
2) Remain silent

Rukias:
I see! The Brave Guard passed 2000 years inside a pod!

Yurii:
But there is no time distortion!

Wendy:
Why? Just now the commander traveled in time, right? Then there should be a distortion, shouldn't there?

Yurii:
...It's unfortunate but from time travel of now and a difference of 2000 years, this world has fundamentally changed .

Haschen:
Is there nothing we can do...

Anita:
...No, there is still a way...
...I will... I will do it.

Yurii:
No, it's dangerous! Even up to now it put a great strain on your body! If you use that power this time, your life will...!

Anita:
But there is no other way!
Iris was about to give her life to fulfill her mission as a Shrine Maiden!
Now, only I have the ability to travel through time! Only I can do it!
Because only I can, then I will do it... Even if it costs my life!

Yurii:
Anita...

Anita:
However, I cannot send everyone with my power. So if you don't cooperate with me, we cannot reach 2000 years in the past.
Please decide everything.
Also one more thing...
Returning 2000 years in the past will be dangerous to only you.
If you meet yourself in the world 2000 years ago, then you won't be able to return to the present.
Compared to the others who were still not born yet, the risk for you is too great.

1) Understood
2) It's nothing compared to Anita's health (*)
3) It's nothing compared to the destruction of the world

Anita:
Is that so. You are that kind of person.
Then I will also fight to the very end.
When you select three people to go with you 2000 years in the past, please choose one person who you want to fight with to the end.
Until the moment that my life is used up, I will muster my strength so that person can remain by your side.
After you restore your physical condition in the pod room, please select your members.

(talk to characters)

Anita:
...I'm uneasy... But, I have to do it.

Haschen:
What's the matter? Before you go to the past, shouldn't you prepare?

Rukias:
We cannot go back from here. You should not neglect preparations so that you're prepared for anything.

Wendy:
2000 years ago, huh... We absolutely cannot fail, so prepare throughly!

Hofman:
You look tired, are you all right? Do restore your physical condition before you depart.

Iristelessa:
Past and future... everything depends on you.

(go to pod room)

Yurii:
We don't know what will happen in the past. Let's leave a record.

(use the panel)

[There are various functions of the clone pods.]
1) Read function explanation
2) Explanations unnecessary (*)

[With current charge level it is possible to use next function.]

1) Use body repair function (*)
2) Don't use

(use save point)

[Warning
From hereafter, when you transfer to the era 2000 years ago you will not be able to return to the present. Because of that it is recommended not to overwrite current save data.]

(keep this save, do not overwrite. walk away)

Yurii:
Then, Sir Hero.
Please choose one person who you want to be with until the end.
I will summon that person, so please tell your feelings.
It can be someone you love. It can be someone you can depend on.
By saying your thoughts, you will strengthen the bond with that person.
Sir Hero, who will you like?
All right, please answer.

1) Select a male here
2) Select a female here
3) Someone not here

(Males)
1) Rukias
2) Hofman
3) Haschen
4) Choose again

(Females)
1) Wendy
2) Iristelessa
3) Anita
4) Yurii
5) Choose again

(for Merklich solo ending or Neilis ending, choose "someone not here"
first I'll do Merklich's)

Yurii:
Someone that is not here...? That is unfortunate.
I hope that someday your feelings will reach that person.

(go back to everyone else)

Yurii:
Then, select three members.

(walk further in)

Wendy:
Hey, have you already decided the members?
I thought about it a lot, but among the members here I'm the one who's been with you longest, right?
In other words I'm the one you're most used to fighting along with, right?
Therefore I will go with you.

Yurii:
Wendy...

Wendy:
It's already decided! In this connection, you have no right to refuse!
So, let's do well until the end!

(select party, go to 008)
#################################
(if choose Wendy)

Yurii:
Wendy, is it? Then, I shall call her right away.

Wendy:
Is something the matter, for suddenly calling me?
Ah, you're also nervous, huh? Honestly I am nervous.
By talking with me we can have a diversion, so let's keep each other company.

Yurii:
Sir Hero says he wants to be with you until the end.

Wendy:
Huh, no, no way...

Yurii:
Is it troubling you?

Wendy:
...No, that's not it... I am just suddenly surprised...
You're not joking... right...?

Yurii:
In no circumstances now could there be joking.
...Then, I shall leave my seat for a little while...

Wendy:
Even though we've always been together, being together like this anew is somehow awkward.
...I see. For you to stand on ceremony, it will be dangerous ahead of here.
If we pass 2000 years and change history, maybe I wouldn't be here any more.
...I might be gone. Then, what should we do...
...Yes, all right...
In return for suddenly being called, I will also suddenly say it!
I... like you.
Ah, this 'like' isn't like for flowers... do you understand...?
Therefore, I'm very glad that you called me like this.
It was battle when we first met. Even when we are to make it end, I knew that everything would be fine if I'm with you.
Whatever happens, I will defend you. Therefore, let's do our best until the end, okay?
If too much time passes, everyone will notice... so shall we get going?

Yurii:
Then let us go to everyone else. 
(go back to everyone else)

Yurii:
Then, let's choose two more members.

(go to 008)

(if choose Rukias)

Yurii:
Rukias, hmm? Then, I will call him right away.

Rukias:
Is something the matter? I am in your debt, so if there's something I can do, tell me.

Yurii:
Sir Hero says he wants to take you the most to the final battle.

Rukias:
What? ...You mean, you think I'm reliable?

Yurii:
Yes. I believe that's what he means.

Rukias:
That's... I'm really glad. You were my goal, so for the day to come that I am reliable to you...
I tried hard to reach your level, but honestly, I've realized that I'm no match.
Not only in physical strength, but strength of heart, getting things accomplished, making everyone trust you... With all of those you are incredible.
For the person that I appreciate to appreciate me back, is there a higher honor than this?
When this battle ends, then I think I will go home to the great land village.
It's mostly broken down, but that's my home. I want it to be reconstructed.
That's... you may not think of it so, but that place is also your home.
...Therefore, when this ends, won't you return together with me? To our home...
If that's decided, then let's make this battle end and return! To our home!

(go back to everyone else)

Yurii:
Then, let's choose two more members.

(go to 008)

(if choose Iristelessa)

Yurii:
Iris, hmm? Then I shall call her right away.

Iristelessa:
Is something the matter? ...If there's something troubling you, please speak your mind.
I'll just listen, I still haven't repaid your favor to me...
I may only be able to listen, but I want to fulfill your hopes.

Yurii:
Then this is probably perfect.
Sir Hero hopes to fight together with Iris until the end.

Iristelessa:
...What!? ...That's...
As the great land Shrine Maiden? Or...

Yurii:
Reaching this stage, there is no such unrefined thing as carrying out a mission.

Iristelessa:
...Then, I'll have you let me say the truth.
If I wasn't chosen by you, then I think it was because I am the Shrine Maiden.
But in this time when we cannot allow failure, I think I'll end up dragging my feet, and I never said so.
But I'll speak honestly. Not as a Shrine Maiden, but as a woman, I want to be with you.
Because we don't know what will happen, I wanted to be with you. So, I'm really glad...
I'll go with you anywhere. Until the end... together...

(go back to everyone else)

Yurii:
Then, let's choose two more members.

(go to 008)

(if choose Anita)

Yurii:
Anita, hmm? Then I shall call her right away.

Anita:
Umm, do you have a question?
Certainly with my physical strength there is limit to the next time travel. I cannot fail, so if there is something...

Yurii:
Anita, it's something else.
Sir Hero would like to be with you until the end.

Anita:
Huh!?
...Uhh... I'm sorry, I didn't realize...
I never thought you would choose me...
And you still don't remember those ten days.
It's because of the operation so maybe it can't be helped.
But, the memories with me were only that much so it was fate, and I was going to give up...
That's what I've been thinking this whole time.
I won't fuss about those ten days any more.
Because I'm having a more precious experience than even that time now.
I will answer your request to the end.
Even if my life burns out...

1) I'm counting on you
2) I will absolutely not let you die (*)

Anita:
...I'm so happy...

(go back to everyone else)

Yurii:
Then, let's choose two more members.

(go to 008)

(if choose Hofman)

Yurii:
Hofman, hmm? Then I shall call him right away.

Hofman:
It seems you want to talk to me, what is it?

Yurii:
Sir Hero would like to ask for Hofman's support in the final battle.

Hofman:
In other words, about going to 2000 years ago?

Yurii:
Yes, that is so. It will be a very dangerous battle but...

Hofman:
...I'm glad to have you call me.
Either way, even if we remain here, danger won't change, right?
I want to head to the past and make results rather than wait here for them.

Yurii:
Hofman...

Hofman:
I'll also count on you. Keep going until the end!

Yurii:
Yes.
Then, let us decide the other two people.

(go back to everyone else)

Yurii:
Then, let's choose two more members.

(go to 008)

(if choose Haschen)

Yurii:
Korin's hero, huh? Then, I will call him right away.

Haschen:
What's the matter? You called only me.

Yurii:
Sir Hero says he depends on you. He wants you to be with him until the end.

Haschen:
...Is that so. Thank you. I'm glad you think that I'm that reliable.
You've helped me a great deal. The fact I am here is also thanks to you.
Will you take this for me?
...Will you take this medal?
If it's you, I can entrust you with this medal's thoughts, and also mine.
Thank you. When this battle is over, come to the Peace Maintenance Brigade.
If it's with you, the thoughts in the medal will change the world to what you hope. Let's do our best together.

(go back to everyone else)

Yurii:
Then, let's choose two more members.

(go to 008)

(if choose Yurii)

Yurii:
M-me? Please stop joking...

1) It's not a joke (*)
2) I was really joking

Yurii:
Sir Hero... I'm very glad.
I will go with you whatever happens.
Even if you get lost in time... I will find you if it takes a thousand years!
Therefore... please keep me by your side...

(go back to everyone else)

Yurii:
Then, select three members.

(walk further in)

Wendy:
Hey, have you already decided the members?
I thought about it a lot, but among the members here I'm the one who's been with you longest, right?
In other words I'm the one you're most used to fighting along with, right?
Therefore I will go with you.

Yurii:
Wendy...

Wendy:
It's already decided! In this connection, you have no right to refuse!
So, let's do well until the end!

(008 select party)

Yurii:
Now you have four people. Ask Anita and let's head to 2000 years ago.

(talk to Anita)

Anita:
It seems you've finished selecting members.
Will you go to 2000 years ago at last?

1) Yes (*)
2) No

Anita:
Then, I will send you to the past.

Wendy (if she's left behind):
I can't help with anything any more. ...Even if I'm not there, do your best!

Rukias (if he's left behind):
As a survivor of the great land village I wanted to be present until the end but... it can't be helped. Good luck!

Iristelessa (if she's left behind):
I will entrust you with the future of this planet. Please do your best.

Hofman (if he's left behind):
When I met you guys, I never even imagined this would happen. But, I have no regrets. We'll leave it to you.

Haschen (if he's left behind):
It's unfortunate that I can't go with you. When you return, do tell me about the past.

Yurii:
Everyone, we will be back!
###########################
First Shrine Maiden:
We've finally cornered you. Please surrender.

First Shrine Maiden's Fairy:
Infinitor! This is the end for you!

Infinitor:
Hahaha. It's very interesting to pass through something I've experienced.

First Shrine Maiden:
What are you saying? There is no chance for you to win!

Infinitor:
Hahaha, this is truly pleasant.
It's because I've grasped that possible chance.

Commander 13:
......

Infinitor:
You will betray me here!

First Shrine Maiden:
N-no...

Commander 13:
...H-how... did you know...

Infinitor:
Didn't I say it? I've grasped that possible chance. I see through all your movements!

First Shrine Maiden's Fairy:
W-what will we do, Shrine Maiden?

Infinitor:
Well, how will I have you die?
How shall I repay the disgrace of 2000 years...
What!? You people!

Yurii:
The time travel... was a success!

Infinitor:
Impossible... Anita!?

(or if Anita is with you)

Infinitor:
Impossible... Anita! You!?

Anita:
The power that I received from you...I will use it for your sake in the end...
To stop you!

Yurii:
What's the matter, Sir Hero?

Wendy (or other char):
Agh, the one from our time... and the existence of the real one...!?

Yurii:
The existences merged...! ...Then, Sir Hero... can't... return to the future...!?

Infinitor:
Hahaha! What do you think now! Didn't you expect it enough!
Well, it will be short with you. I will make you disappear before we ever really met!

Neilis:
Infinitor, let me take care of that!
I also have a grudge of 2000 years!

Commander 13:
You can't... I must protect... the Shrine Maiden...

======================================
MISSION BATTLE 44 The Beginning of Everything

======================================

(go near Neilis)

Neilis:
Is that so...
Together with that guy, he is a soldier who betrayed with his own purpose.
The soldier who was the number one subordinate of that guy. That was you?
It's no wonder you are different from the other clones.
Then, I will kill you, and completely deal with the traitor!

Yurii:
She is.. the same as Sir Hero, merged into this time...?

(if Merklich attacks Infinitor)

Infinitor:
Isn't it nostalgic? Will you let me hear your impressions of returning to the original world?

(if Haschen attacks Infinitor)

Infinitor:
A warrior of Goatland, huh...

Haschen:
I have things I want to protect. So I cannot lose.

(if Wendy attacks Infinitor)

Wendy:
We won't let you do as you want with this planet!

Infinitor:
Hahahaha, it's a little girl spouting nonsense!

(if Rukias attacks Infinitor)

Rukias:
The mission of the great land village... We will fulfill it!

Infinitor:
Then I will release you from that mission. For eternity!

(if Hofman attacks Infinitor)

Hofman:
Fomeros or Hingistan has nothing to do with this. Now we have to beat a bigger enemy!

Infinitor:
There is nothing to worry, from now there will be no such thing as humans' little countries!

(if Anita attacks Infinitor)

Infinitor:
I have to thank you. It's because you had that operation that I am here.

Anita:
I will also thank you. You gave me the power to fight against evil!

(if Iristelessa attacks Infinitor)

Iristelessa:
This planet belongs to the people who live here. Not you who has come from a different world!

Infinitor:
How beautiful... Humans attack their neighbor countries. This is the same thing, just in different scale!

(defeat Neilis)

Neilis:
Aagh!
...Why... Why can't I win...

Infinitor:
How worthless...

(if Shrine Maiden suffers a lot of damage)

First Shrine Maiden:
Ugh...

First Shrine Maiden's Fairy:
Shrine Maiden, hang in there!

First Shrine Maiden:
I am all right... I can go a little more...

(after a while)

First Shrine Maiden's Fairy:
Shrine Maiden, now!

First Shrine Maiden:
Yes!
...Ugh... Why? Even with the Dragon Orb's power, I can't seal it...

Yurii:
She can't endure any more...

(defeat Infinitor)

Infinitor:
...Nngh... This body can't hold any more... I'll have to return to my true body.

(after battle)

Commander 13:
...Just what...exactly happened?

Yurii:
We don't have much time so I can't explain in detail, but we came from 2000 years in the future to go after Infinitor.
The Infinitor we fought a while ago is not the Infinitor of this era.

Commander 13:
Came from the future... So that's how he knew I'd betray him.

Yurii:
The Infinitor now has resistance against the Dragon Orb so he can't be sealed.

Merklich:
1) Leave the rest to us
2) Make them escape now
3) We will go destroy the true body (*)

Commander 13:
That face... I see. My will was passed on.

Yurii:
Leave the rest to us, you and the Shrine Maiden please escape.

Commander 13:
I want to fight also, but... with this body I'll only hinder you.
...All right.
I will entrust this planet to you. I'll count on you!

Wendy (if you chose her or no one):
Hey, is it just your body here now? Do you remember me?
I don't know what I should say, but... you are not alone!
...I am here...

Rukias (if you chose him):
Are you all right? Can you really fight?
...But when this battle ends, you're already...
...I'm sorry... you're not normal. So I'll defend you with all my strength.

Iristelessa (if you chose her):
Ah... is your body all right...? The thing that we feared would happen has occured.
I don't know what I should say, but... I will be with you until the end...

Anita (if you chose her):
...It's what we feared, but now it happened.
I had predicted it but to see it really happen is painful...
At least until the end... I will be with you until the end.

Hofman (if you chose him):
Uh... this is the first time I've traveled through time...  I don't really understand when they say you'll be left in the past.
Only you know your heart's intentions, but I can know the disappointment of not being able to meet you again.
I have respect for you who came to this era knowing that danger.
Therefore, until the very end, I will fight for you.

Haschen (if you chose him):
Is that true? That you can't return to the future...
...I see, even though we got this far together...
Then I will accomplish my duty. I will fight with my full strength with you until the end.

(talk to Neilis)

Neilis:
...No matter what.. I couldn't win...
So this is the difference between someone with conviction and someone who only follows orders...
I don't have strength to fight any more. You can proceed ahead at once.
Is his will remaining in you? Fulfill that mission immediately!

(rest in pods, go back to first map)

Rukias (or other char):
...How much longer can we stay in this era...?

Yurii:
Anita is doing her best, but to transfer 2000 years... We could be sent back at any moment.
More importantly, there is something I want you all to be cautioned about.

(or if Anita is with you)
Anita:
...I'm sorry...I'm trying with all my might, but I cannot keep it up too long.
More importantly, there is something I want you all to be cautioned about.

Rukias (or other char):
...What is it?

Yurii:
If Anita's power doesn't hold and we get returned to the present...
The difference of 2000 years' time will make a large shockwave in the surrounding airspace.
Speaking simply, when we return to the present, there is possibility the people within the area will receive damage.
Therefore I need you to be aware.

(or if Anita is with you)
Anita:
If my power doesn't hold and we get returned to the present...
The difference of 2000 years' time will make a large shockwave in the surrounding airspace.
Speaking simply, when we return to the present, there is possibility the people within the area will receive damage.
Therefore I need you to be aware.

Rukias (or other char):
...Understood.
But can it be used for attack? When we disappear, then the Infinitor can go die!

Yurii:
That's the spirit, everyone! If we don't give up then we'll sure win through to the future we hope!

(hit the switch at right, destroy the enemies and gate device.
go near the big purple warp point)

Yurii:
In this era it looks like this transfer device can be used.

Wendy (if you chose her or no one):
When we go through here it will finally be the deciding battle with Infinitor.

1) There is nothing to fear (*)
2) This is the end

Wendy:
That's what I was going to say! You're really...
...I said it a while ago, but you are not alone. Therefore... believe in me...!

Rukias (if you chose him):
When we go through here it will finally be the deciding battle...

1) There is nothing to fear
2) This is the end (*)

Rukias:
Yeah, that's right. The mission of the village, and your mission as Brave Guard.
Hey, we won't get anywhere if we stay here. Let's hurry and go.

Iristelessa (if you chose her):
Beyond this device is the Infinitor.

1) There is nothing to fear (*)
2) This is the end

Iristelessa:
I'm not afraid of the battle. It's about afterwards...
When the battle ends, other things will also end. It can't be avoided so that's what I'm afraid of.
But, precisely because of that I want to fight through to the end.

Anita (if you chose her):
Beyond this device is the Infinitor.

1) There is nothing to fear (*)
2) This is the end

Anita:
Yes, the end of everything.
I'm sorry that you have to be burdened by everyone's hopes.
If I can shoulder your burden even a little bit by being here... I'll believe I can do it, and I can keep going.

Hofman (if you chose him):
Ahead of this device is the enemy we're aiming after, huh.

1) There is nothing to fear
2) This is the end (*)

Hofman:
Hey hey, don't let the feeling down.
I have something I want to say at the end, but... if this is the end of everything...

Haschen (if you chose him):
Ahead of here is the Infinitor...

1) There is nothing to fear
2) This is the end (*)

Haschen:
Yeah, that's right, but...
I'm not very used to this feeling.
It would feel more easy if we fought leaving it to course of events.

(use the device)

Yurii:
We don't know what will happen...
Please be careful.

[There is a transfer device. Will you transfer?]
1) Transfer (*)
2) Don't transfer

Rukias (or other char):
So this is the celestial ship's deepest part...

Yurii:
The Infinitor's true body must be inside that?

Infinitor:
You obstinate fools...
However, this is the end.
You can gratefully die here!

Yurii:
Everyone, this is the finale! Please do your best!

after a while...)

(if Rukias)

Rukias:
...This feeling...! Tch, time is going to run out...

Yurii:
Rukias?

Rukias:
But, it's not going to end like this!

Rukias
All right?! Even if I'm not here, don't give up until the very end!

Yurii:
Rukias!

(if Hofman)

Hofman:
This feeling... It looks like I can only stay in this era a little bit more.

Yurii:
Hofman?

Hofman:
Then I will help to make you succeed at the end!

Hofman:
This is the spirit of a Fomeros soldier! I will leave the rest to you!

Yurii:
Hofman!

(if Haschen)

Haschen:
...Ugh! I'm getting close to the limit of how long I can be in this time period...

Yurii:
Korin's hero!

Haschen:
In that case, to the end...!

Haschen:
I will untrust the fate of the planet to you. Believe in yourself and fight to the end!

Yurii:
Korin's hero!

(defeat the outer layer)

Infinitor:
...My outer shell is destroyed...
It can't be helped. I will directly be your opponent...!

(after a while, second person will leave)

(if Wendy)

Wendy:
...Ugh! It looks like I'm reaching my limit too...

Yurii:
Wendy!

Wendy:
Then, for the end...!

Wendy:
I wanted to be with you until the end, but I can only go up to here...
I'll leave the rest to you! Please save this planet!

Yurii:
Wendy!

(after a while)

(if Rukias)

Rukias:
...This feeling...! Tch! At last my time is going to run out too...

Yurii:
Rukias?

Rukias:
But, it's not going to end like this!

Rukias
All right?! Even if I'm not here, don't give up until the very end!

Yurii:
Rukias!

(if Anita)

Anita:
Ahh, it's, it's no good... I can't stay in this time period any longer...

Yurii:
Anita!

Anita:
I wanted to at least see the end...!

Anita:
I will leave the rest to you. Please save the future!

Yurii:
Anita!

(if Iristelessa)

Iristelessa:
...This feeling... I can't stay here any longer too?

Yurii:
Iris?

Iristelessa:
In that case, I will fulfill my last duty!

Iristelessa:
You can see it through to the end! I believe in you!

Yurii:
Iris!

(if Wendy is left)

Wendy:
It's finally just two people left. But, there's no need to be uneasy. If I'm with you, then we can win through this time too!

(if Rukias is left)

Rukias:
It's finally just two people left, even though it wasn't easy with four people. But if we can defeat that with two people then we are unmistakably heroes. Let's go!

(if Iristelessa is left)

Iristelessa:
It's finally just two people left. The Shrine Maiden and the Brave Guard... it doesn't matter either way what we are. With the two of us, we'll grasp victory!

(if Anita is left)

Anita:
...It's finally just two people left... But we cannot betray everyone's hopes. We will absolutely win!

(if Hofman is left)

It's finally just two people left. But if I'm with you then we won't lose. Let's fight hard until the end!

(if Haschen is left)

Haschen:
...It's finally just two people left... But we won't let their hopes be in vain! We'll absolutely win!

(defeat Infinitor)

Infinitor:
You've made it this far...
Stint in power in this stage is meaningless.
I will show you my true power!

(defeat Infinitor)

Infinitor:
Aaarrgghhh!

Yurii:
We did it!?

Infinitor:
B-body... my body...!
How could I... lose to these lower beings--!

Yurii:
...We succeeded... The Infinitor is really defeated...

Wendy (if she is left):
Now... we're really going to part. Furthermore, 2000 years...?
I wonder if I can be born in the world of 2000 years from now...

(if you chose Wendy)

Wendy:
......
...No... I don't want to leave you! If this is the end... this... this is...!
...Wait! I'll be waiting! I'll be waiting however long it takes!

Yurii:
Wendy...

Iristelessa (if she is left):
It is over. It seems our strength won through somehow.
To change history greatly like this, I worry if I have a place in the future.
At least, the you of before lived 2000 years and met me.
Therefore, I believe we will meet again. So, I won't say goodbye.
...Ah... It's already time. I will be waiting... so come meet me without fail...

Yurii:
Iris...

Anita (if she is left):
...Ugh...

Yurii:
Anita!

Anita:
I don't want to return... I don't want to separate from you!
Before it was just a few days, several weeks' change in the past, but for 2000 years a whole continent being sealed will not happen...
The future that we were in will be no more... The day we met is no more...
...Aughh! ...No...make it stop... right now...

Yurii:
Anita...

Hofman (if he is left):
...We made it in time.
Actually my body has been feeling like it's being pulled somewhere...
I've been trying to strain against it, but I'm reaching the limits.
I'm glad to defeat Infinitor with you...
The only regret is that I have to leave you in this era.
I regret it but there's nothing I can do...
Speaking of which, I've thought we should go have a drink or something...
...Ugh, this is the limit... Sorry, I'm going to leave you...

Yurii:
...Hofman...

Haschen (if he is left):
Yeah. From now it's supposed to continue, the tragic history won't happen.
...Sorry. It looks like it's also come time for me to return to the present...
...I will believe in it. I will meet with you again, that future will happen!

Yurii:
Yes...

Haschen:
If the power of wills makes the future, then it certainly will! Therefore I won't say goodbye. See you again...

Rukias (if he is left):
...It's over... it's all over.
...Damn it... We accomplished our objective, but why does it feel regrettable...
I could finally stand side by side with you, but is this really the end of everything? Are we going to part here!?
...Sorry... I'm really a child. I'm only saying things to trouble you in such a time.
...Thank you for everything... I will never forget you! I'll wait however long it takes, at that village...!

Yurii:
Rukias...

---

Yurii:
It is just two of us left. But I'm with Sir Hero.
Maybe we can't return to the future, but we will live in this era.
At this rate we'll sink with the ship. Let us escape!

(or if you chose Yurii)
Yurii:
At last, Sir Hero is completely alone...

1) Ask if she's not returning
2) Yurii should hurry and return
3) Yurii is with me (*)

Yurii:
...Yes, Sir Hero... Yurii will not part from your side.
But, if we stay here we will sink with the ship. Let us escape while we can.
Even if you can't return to the future, I can live in any era if I am with you.

(use the big purple warp. go back to pod room. use control panel)

(if you're going for Neilis, talk to her on the way)
Neilis:
...So you defeated Infinitor.
If I knew it would come to this that time, I would have helped you from the start...
If... if... I could do it over, I'd want to be with you.
Not as a servant of a creator, but with my own will... I want to walk to the future with my own feet.
...Hmph, what am I being weak for. Before I die, there is no need for this pratter.
...My body can't move. Leave me be.
If you don't escape quickly, you'll miss your chance...

1) Leave her
2) Take her along and escape (*)

Yurii:
Sir Hero, we will part for a bit.
We shall meet on land!

(anime scene)

(if you chose a character to be with)
Yurii:
This place is... Looks like we made it back safely.
It feels like a lot of time has passed since that fight.
Speaking definitely, it is several months since then.
For about 2000 years you've had a long, long sleep.

---

(Yurii human anime if you chose her)
Yurii:
Sir Hero, it has been a while!
Ah, this body... I'm a human...?
The clone pod.. turned me into a human?
Sir Hero, I'm so happy!
It's really like a dream!
In that story the fairy couldn't turn into a human, and I kept brooding over it.
But now I've turned into a human.
Therefore now I can say it to you.
I like you.
I love you, From now I will only love you so please, let me stay by your side.

---

(Neilis anime if you chose her)
Neilis:
Where is this?

Yurii:
You have awoken? From then 2000 years have passed, but are you all right?

Neilis:
2000 years?
I see.
I am saved by you again?
When we defeated Infinitor, my heart has been liberated.
And you've also saved my life.
Do you remember those words?
If I could do it over again, I want to be with you.
That's the truth.
If it's all right with you.
Thank you, for accepting me.
What is it, this warm feeling, this comfort...
I see.
You people fought for this feeling.
I finally understand it.
Thank you.
Please stay like this from now too.

Yurii:
...This is Dastis, huh? I wonder how much it changed in 2000 years?

(if Neilis with you)
Neilis:
So this is the world I will live in with you...
I would like to know how it changed.

(walk further in)

Woman:
I'm begging you, please forgive me!

Man:
Today I cannot!
Why do you only waste money!

Woman:
Th-that's...

Man:
I always work hard and sweat, and what do you do with that money!
At any rate I'm going to work! At least go clean up!

Yurii:
...It's somehow pleasant...

(if Neilis is with you)
Neilis:
Don't be so charmed. If only men were not like that..!

(if Yurii is human)
Yurii:
...Please don't worry. I would never want to trouble you.

(exit town)

Yurii:
...We arrived in Royferon. As we can see, this place is also peaceful.

(if Neilis is with you)
Neilis:
Before you changed history, I'd never been to this city before. Please show me around.

(go into jewel shop)
Neilis:
What's that man and woman looking at? Hey, what is this place for?

(talk to lady at counter)

Woman:
Welcome. Please feel free to look at our shop's jewels.

Neilis:
It's sparkly and beautiful. It would be a good design to have those together with my barette.
...I don't particularly want them that much!

(walk further in)

Fomeros Base Commander:
Then, I will leave the rest ot you.

Fomeros Soldier:
Yes! Understood!

Fomeros Base Commander:
Hm? I remember you...
You were with Hofman... But where did I meet you...?
Maybe it's my imagination.
Sorry, I said something strange.
You seem to be a traveler. Do make yourself comfortable in this city.
Well then, excuse me.

(exit town)

Yurii:
...It's El Hingis! The world hasn't changed a lot so it's a relief.
...No, it seems details have changed, but however we say it, it's become a good world.
If this is the result of the change we made a long time ago at 2000 years ago...
Then it's not exaggerating to say that you made this world.

(if Neilis is with you)
Neilis:
I haven't been here either.
But it's very interesting to explore the world like this with you!
Furthermore, a world that you made!

(walk further in)

Man:
Eeek!

Woman:
Hey you! Give us back our food!
...Indeed! That is even the former prime minister...?

(enter inn)

Yurii:
...Ah, that person is...

(if Neilis is with you)
Neilis:
Someone you know? Then maybe you should introduce me.

(talk to Maxwell)

Maxwell:
Oh, I've seen you somewhere...
...Sorry, I can't remember where I met you...
I am Maxwell. I help with the Hingistan independent council.
This country will steadily change. Do watch over it.

(exit city)

(if alone)

[2000 years after that fight--- the people's lifestyles were the same as before you changed the world.
But, it was fine---
Merklich stepped to a new world...]

Yurii:
...Thank goodness. The people's lifestyles that you protects are even being protected in this era.

(if chose a party character)
Yurii:
Well, shall we go meet that person soon? They're surely waiting for you!

(if chose Yurii)
Yurii:
Well, where shall we go next?
From now I'm the same as you, walking on my feet as a human, and I can see things as a human!
From here on also, please let me be by your side forever, okay?

(if chose Neilis)
Neilis:
...Thank goodness. The things you protected are all as normal.
I'm relieved.
However I say it, I had been obstructing you...
Well, where will we go next? I want to travel in all of the world that you saved!

[Time doesn't stop flowing
People don't stop living
No matter what the era
No matter what the place
As long as the thoughts are there Everything links together
Therefore people keep on walking
Even in times when what's ahead can't be seen
As long as the thoughts are there they never give up]

(Wendy anime if you chose her)
Wendy:
Even after that battle which changed history, a revolution occured in Hingistan.
I now work as a captain of a guard troop to protect the citizens' lives.
Welcome back! I've been waiting. I believed the whole time and waited.
When I just think that we couldn't meet again, I couldn't even stand.
Therefore, I believed we would absolutely meet again. Even passing 2000 years, this could be called fate.
I'm not going to part from you again.

(Rukias anime if you chose him)
Rukias:
We defeated the Infinitor in the past.
So the village never had a mission, and it fell into ruin in time.
Even so... this is my... our native village.
You're late! You promised that we'd revive our home together.
I almost thought you forgot.
My home village will be reconstructed in a little more... it's also your home.
I still haven't given up on trying to surpass you.
You are my goal, so I'm going to stay by your side!

(Iristelessa anime if you chose her)
Iristelessa:
With the death of Infinitor, my mission as Shrine Maiden was also cancelled before I was born.
The village is in peace, yet I am here.
Do you understand what I felt?
The world changed, and I was released from the mission of Shrine Maiden, and I couldn't be by the one who made me realize joy.
It was harsh.
You were very late, weren't you.
My loneliness... it was harsh.
I waited the whole time, but I couldn't stand to wait any more!
Please promise me, that you will not leave my side.
I love you.

(Anita anime if you chose her)
Anita:
That day, after the experience of completely changing a history of 2000 years, I hoped for the world that I had known well.
I have been passing my days busily as commander of Monopolis.

Shayer:
Miss Anita, you have worked hard.
I will also return now.

Anita:
Thanks for your hard work.
I will return after I rest a little.

Shayer:
Yes, Miss Anita.
Please do not overexert yourself.

Anita:
I have been waiting.
I believed in it.
That you would absolutely return.
From the effect of 2000 years ago, those ten days had become lost.
But I believed it, that we would meet again after passing a long time, Yurii said it before, that the future is not decided, and things will occur in reality if you wish for them.
Therefore, even during that battle, I wished for it.
That we could meet once again, and that I could be held by you.
Welcome back, my beloved.

(Hofman anime if you chose him)
Hofman:
Even upon returning from that battle, there was no great change in the conscription.
My brother, as promised to the public, pulled Hingistan toward peace, and I've got my hands full of work.
I knew it! You've returned! Just what kind of future had you created?
Well, let us talk leisurely about that later.
Since then the world has changed, but a war broke out between Fomeros and Hingistan.
But my elder brother became president, and making Fomeros withdraw was still a fact.
There is a lot I want to tell you.
All right!
To celebrate your return, let us drink tonight!

From the change in reality 2000 years ago, there was no barrier on this continent. Even so humans still waged war, and as a result, the Peace Maintenance Brigade was formed.
