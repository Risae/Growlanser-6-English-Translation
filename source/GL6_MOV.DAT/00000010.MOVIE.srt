00:00:01,079 --> 00:00:07,111
Even after that battle which changed history, a revolution occured in Hingistan.

2
00:00:08,196 --> 00:00:14,479
I now work as a captain of a guard troop to protect the citizens' lives.

3
00:00:25,324 --> 00:00:27,981
Welcome back! I've been waiting.

4
00:00:27,981 --> 00:00:30,450
I believed the whole time and waited.

5
00:00:30,450 --> 00:00:33,181
When I just think that we couldn't meet again,

6
00:00:33,181 --> 00:00:35,597
 I couldn't even stand.

7
00:00:36,176 --> 00:00:38,257
Therefore,

8
00:00:38,257 --> 00:00:41,000
 I believed we would absolutely meet again.

9
00:00:42,055 --> 00:00:46,044
Even passing 2000 years,

10
00:00:46,044 --> 00:00:49,097
this could be called fate.

11
00:00:49,588 --> 00:00:52,100
I'm not going to part from you again.
