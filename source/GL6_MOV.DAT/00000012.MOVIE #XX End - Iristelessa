#### Original Title: イリステレサ ####


Iristelessa:
With the death of Infinitor, my mission as Shrine Maiden was also cancelled before I was born.
The village is in peace, yet I am here.
Do you understand what I felt?
The world changed, and I was released from the mission of Shrine Maiden, and I couldn't be by the one who made me realize joy.
It was harsh.
You were very late, weren't you.
My loneliness... it was harsh.
I waited the whole time, but I couldn't stand to wait any more!
Please promise me, that you will not leave my side.
I love you.
