00:00:01,480 --> 00:00:10,058
We defeated the Infinitor in the past, so the village never had a mission and it fell into ruin in time.

2
00:00:10,820 --> 00:00:14,223
Even so... this is my...

3
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,032
Our native village.

4
00:00:31,617 --> 00:00:36,840
You're late!
You promised that we'd revive our home together.

5
00:00:37,373 --> 00:00:39,179
I almost thought you forgot.

6
00:00:40,330 --> 00:00:47,486
My home village will be reconstructed in a little more... it's also your home.

7
00:00:52,043 --> 00:00:55,811
I still haven't given up on trying to surpass you.

8
00:00:56,659 --> 00:01:01,616
You are my goal, so I'm going to stay by your side!
