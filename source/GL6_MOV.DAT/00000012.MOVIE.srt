1
00:00:01,320 --> 00:00:07,487
With the death of Infinitor, my mission as Shrine Maiden was also cancelled before I was born.

2
00:00:07,487 --> 00:00:11,888
The village is in peace, yet I am here.

3
00:00:37,412 --> 00:00:39,664
Do you understand what I felt?

4
00:00:39,664 --> 00:00:47,242
The world changed, and I was released from the mission of Shrine Maiden, and I couldn't be by the one who made me realize joy.

5
00:00:47,703 --> 00:00:50,212
It was harsh. You were very late, weren't you.

6
00:00:51,015 --> 00:00:55,212
My loneliness... it was harsh.

7
00:00:56,886 --> 00:01:02,670
I waited the whole time, but I couldn't stand to wait any more!

8
00:01:02,888 --> 00:01:05,655
Please promise me,

9
00:01:05,655 --> 00:01:08,056
that you will not leave my side.

10
00:01:09,196 --> 00:01:10,374
I love you.
