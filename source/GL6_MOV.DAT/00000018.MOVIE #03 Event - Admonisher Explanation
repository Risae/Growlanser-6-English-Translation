#### Original Title: アドモニッシャー解説 ####

Yurii:
The Peace Maintenance Brigade was formed twenty years ago.
They stopped war on the continent by reviving a great ancient weapon and using its power.

Wendy:
A great weapon's power?

Yurii:
The Admonisher was a very powerful weapon.
By one shot, it could instantly make a whole land perish, and kill several hundred people.

Wendy:
What a tremendous weapon...
It seems a lot like Hingistan's giant.
But if they had such a powerful weapon, couldn't they use it to kill the Queen Screaper?

Yurii:
Actually, it was already used.
When that Queen was still alive, the Admonisher crashed into the Queen's seal to break it.

Wendy:
Wow...
Even with such a strong weapon, it couldn't destroy the Queen...
