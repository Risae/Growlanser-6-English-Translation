#### Original Title: ルキアス ####



Rukias:
We defeated the Infinitor in the past.
So the village never had a mission, and it fell into ruin in time.
Even so... this is my... our native village.
You're late! You promised that we'd revive our home together.
I almost thought you forgot.
My home village will be reconstructed in a little more... it's also your home.
I still haven't given up on trying to surpass you.
You are my goal, so I'm going to stay by your side!
