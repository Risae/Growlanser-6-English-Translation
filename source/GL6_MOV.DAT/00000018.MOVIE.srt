00:00:00,704 --> 00:00:10,400
The Peace Maintenance Brigade was formed twenty years ago.
They stopped war on the continent by reviving a great ancient weapon and using its power.

2
00:00:11,700 --> 00:00:14,224
A great weapon's power?

3
00:00:15,264 --> 00:00:19,008
The Admonisher was a very powerful weapon.

4
00:00:19,400 --> 00:00:26,730
With one shot it could instantly make a whole land perish and kill several hundred people.

5
00:00:29,900 --> 00:00:31,950
What a tremendous weapon...

6
00:00:32,020 --> 00:00:34,840
It seems a lot like Hingistan's giant.

7
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:42,150
But if they had such a powerful weapon, couldn't they use it to kill the Queen Screaper?

8
00:00:43,270 --> 00:00:45,790
Actually, it was already used.

9
00:00:46,090 --> 00:00:53,980
When that Queen was still alive, the Admonisher crashed into the Queen's seal to break it.

10
00:00:55,140 --> 00:00:56,930
Wow...

11
00:00:57,100 --> 00:01:00,910
Even with such a strong weapon, it couldn't destroy the Queen...
