Neilis:
Where is this?

Yurii:
You have awoken?
From then 2000 years have passed, but are you all right?

Neilis:
2000 years?
I see.
I am saved by you again?
When we defeated Infinitor, my heart has been liberated.
And you've also saved my life.
Do you remember those words?
If I could do it over again, I want to be with you.
That's the truth.
If it's all right with you.
Thank you, for accepting me.
What is it, this warm feeling, this comfort...
I see.
You people fought for this feeling.
I finally understand it.
Thank you.
Please stay like this from now too.
