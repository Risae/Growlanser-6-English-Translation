#### Original Title: 爆発の地響き ####


Rukias:
Ugh, what was that!

Wendy:
What's the matter, Yurii?

Yurii:
Humans... many humans lives... instantly...

Wendy:
They were killed? It can't be, the Admonisher?!

Yurii:
Not just killed... more like total annihilation!

Wendy:
Annihilation...?

Rukias:
Ugh!

Wendy:
Where... just where is it!?

Rukias:
That blast was in the south direction. Pretty far south...

Wendy:
South is... Felmentia's direction.
