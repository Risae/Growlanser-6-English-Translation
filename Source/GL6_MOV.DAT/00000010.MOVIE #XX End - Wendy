#### Original Title: ウェンディ ####


Wendy:
Even after that battle which changed history, a revolution occured in Hingistan.
I now work as a captain of a guard troop to protect the citizens' lives.
Welcome back! I've been waiting. I believed the whole time and waited.
When I just think that we couldn't meet again, I couldn't even stand.
Therefore, I believed we would absolutely meet again. Even passing 2000 years, this could be called fate.
I'm not going to part from you again.
