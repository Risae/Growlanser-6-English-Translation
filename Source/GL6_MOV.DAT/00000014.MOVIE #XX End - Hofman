#### Original Title: ホフマン ####


Hofman:
Even upon returning from that battle, there was no great change in the conscription.
My brother, as promised to the public, pulled Hingistan toward peace, and I've got my hands full of work.
I knew it!
You've returned!
Just what kind of future had you created?
Well, let us talk leisurely about that later.
Since then the world has changed, but a war broke out between Fomeros and Hingistan.
But my elder brother became president, and making Fomeros withdraw was still a fact.
There is a lot I want to tell you.
All right!
To celebrate your return, let us drink tonight!
